{100}{}{You see Mayor Alvaro.}
{101}{}{You see a frail-looking Mexican man with a thin mustache and an apologetic expression.}
{102}{}{Put that away immediately. No weapons are allowed in town.}
{103}{}{We are a quiet community. There's no need to walk around with that and scare the civilians.}
{104}{}{Did something happen? Go back to bed immediately! There is a curfew in town at night.}
{105}{}{They demand decisions from me. What can I do? I was just signing papers for the Brotherhood!}

#First meeting
{200}{}{Oh, a new face in town! What a pleasant surprise... Greetings. You could say I'm the mayor of this town. My name is Alvaro.}
{2200}{}{Oh, a new face in town! AND WHAT A FACE! Do you even realize how you look to the locals? As the mayor of this town, I'm asking you to leave as soon as you finish your business. By the way, my name is Alvaro.}
{201}{}{Hello, Mayor.}
{202}{}{Hmm. Don't want to tell me your name? I won't insist. You must have your reasons.}
{203}{}{Yes, that's right.}
{204}{}{I'm }
{205}{}{. It's a pleasure, Senor Alvaro.}
{206}{}{Good manners? Then you and I are going to get along well.}
{207}{}{Thanks for the warm welcome.}
{208}{}{You are a pitiful sight, mayor. And this is what you call a town?}
{209}{}{Uh, yes, I realize it's not as big as Phoenix or its outskirts. Besides the Sonoran Desert, I've never seen much. But look -- isn't it peaceful here?}
{210}{}{I suppose so.}
{211}{}{It's just terrible here -- there's no civilization.}
{212}{}{May I know where you're going?}
{213}{}{I don't know. I'm going wherever my feet lead me.}
{214}{}{Well, okay, I'll take your word for it. It's really none of my business.}
{215}{}{Thanks for your understanding.}
{216}{}{That's it.}
{217}{}{You can count on an overnight stay in our town. But you must follow the rules. You're not going to cause us problems, are you?}
{218}{}{Of course not. And thanks for the offer.}
{219}{}{I don't bite unless I'm bothered. Bear that in mind.}
{220}{}{I serve the Brotherhood of Steel. Here's my badge.}
{221}{}{Oh, welcome! Didn't recognize... Uh... We are always glad to have our defenders. Make yourself comfortable.}
{222}{}{Thanks.}
{223}{}{Right away.}
{224}{}{I'm heading to Puerto. I have business there.}
{225}{}{That's surprising. Usually only caravans go in that direction without permission. But if you don't want to talk, I won't insist.}
{226}{}{Thanks for your understanding.}
{227}{}{As they say, silence is worth more than a sack of corn.}
{228}{}{None of your business.}
{229}{}{Well, let's assume it's really none of my business. Regardless, don't be rude or aggressive -- we are a peaceful settlement.}
{230}{}{Sorry, it was in the heat of the moment -- just tired from the road...}
{231}{}{If you don't want conflict, don't start it yourself. Got it?}
{232}{}{Glad to chat, but I have a lot of paperwork to do right now.}
{233}{}{See you later.}
{234}{}{We have the same name? What a funny coincidence. Then we're sure to get along well.}

{239}{}{That means your town is doomed. Get out of here before the mob comes for you, loser mayor.}
{240}{}{(grabbing his head in his hands, the mayor sits at the table and ignores those around him) ugh...}
{241}{}{You look like crap. Did something happen?}
{242}{}{Everything is lost... We used to survive thanks to the Brotherhood of Steel. And recently a messenger came with bad news...}
{243}{}{Yes, I know -- the Brotherhood has been destroyed. Probably an explosion at an ammunition depot.}
{244}{}{What should we do now? Who'll protect us? Who will tell us what to do?}
{245}{}{What about the Followers?}
{246}{}{They are not warriors and there are very few of them to solve so many issues. This is hopelessness... Everything is lost... everything is lost...}
{247}{}{Hey Alvaro, pull yourself together! You're the mayor. Now everything is in your hands. You are free from total control and oppression. Isn't that wonderful?}
{248}{}{Yes... of course... But what kind of mayor am I? I was just doing paperwork under the supervision of people from the Brotherhood. Now we have to survive on our own. It won't be easy.}
{249}{}{You will succeed. I believe in you.}

#Repeated meeting
{250}{}{Sorry, I have a lot of paperwork to do right now.}
{251}{}{Goodbye.}
{252}{}{How can I help you, dear friend?}
{253}{}{Hello, our new hero. How can I assist you?}
{1253}{}{Hello, our new heroine. How can I assist you?}
{254}{}{See you around.}

{260}{}{Rumor has it people have been disappearing around here. Is that true?}
{261}{}{Who told you that?}
{262}{}{I'm not saying.}
{263}{}{Oh, well of course, no one goes missing here! Except for some criminals who escaped during the town's construction.}
{264}{}{I see.}
{265}{}{I hope you don't spread these nasty, untrue rumors any further.}
{266}{}{Of course. No problem.}
{267}{}{Only until it turns out you're lying. Adios, Mr. Mayor.}
{268}{}{Rosalia. She says you forbade anyone to look for her husband.}
{269}{}{What nonsense! I haven't forbidden the search -- let her search. But she can't find him because her hubby just skipped town. Her bitchy temper must have driven him away.}
{270}{}{I see.}
{271}{}{No worries -- the old witch is going crazy.}

{280}{}{Please tell me about this town.}
{281}{}{We are a peaceful peasant community. Half the people work on plantations, the rest in various peaceful activities. The Followers even have their own school here.}
{282}{}{Thanks for your answer.}
{283}{}{What do they grow here?}
{284}{}{Mostly corn and fire agave. The whole town lives off these plantations.}
{285}{}{So you trade with other cities?}
{286}{}{The harvest is only enough for our needs and for nearby settlements. A caravan from Phoenix regularly comes for agave syrup.}
{287}{}{By the way, what settlements are around?}
{288}{}{I see.}
{289}{}{Puerto to the west and Two-Sun to the east. That's all, except a few small villages and outposts here and there. They come and go, hardly worth noticing.}
{290}{}{Thanks.}
{291}{}{A real oasis in the desert. How is this possible?}
{292}{}{We thank the Followers of the Apocalypse for their intelligence and kindness. They developed plant varieties that can thrive in the dry desert.}
{293}{}{Are other cities buying your crops too?}
{294}{}{Who are the Followers?}
{295}{}{By the way, who are these Followers?}
{296}{}{Followers of the Apocalypse... It's a strange name, but we're used to it. They conduct scientific research, teach children, and treat diseases. The plantation itself appeared thanks to their experiments. But it's easier for you to ask the Followers themselves.}
{297}{}{I know of another group -- the Followers of Fire in Phoenix.}
{298}{}{I've heard of them, but we never crossed paths. Except for the caravans that come from Phoenix.}
{299}{}{By the way, why is alcohol banned here?}
{300}{}{Why is alcohol banned here?}
{301}{}{Technically, only strong alcohol is prohibited. We have too much work to do to spend time on entertainment. After the harvest, the peasants get a couple of days of complete freedom.}
{302}{}{Interestingly, there are no guards here. Aren't you afraid of slavers or raiders?}
{303}{}{About your "peaceful" community -- aren't you afraid of slavers or raiders?}
{304}{}{Why should we be afraid? Our patrons keep order in these lands. We are peaceful people and do only peaceful things. We are not even allowed to have weapons. So there's nothing to fear.}
{305}{}{Yes, you have a real oasis here. How did this become possible?}
{306}{}{Patrons? Who are they?}
{307}{}{What, you don't know about the military base in Puerto? Then I shouldn't discuss this with you. Just know that someone stands up for us.}
{308}{}{You know who we're talking about -- the Brotherhood of Steel. They are now the masters of these lands.}

{310}{}{How do you feel about the Brotherhood of Steel?}
{311}{}{They are our patrons. We couldn't survive without them.}
{312}{}{I see.}
{313}{}{Honestly?}
{314}{}{That's the honest answer.}
{315}{}{That's good.}
{316}{}{So be it -- I guess I'll believe it.}
{317}{}{I don't hear any joy or admiration in your words.}
{318}{}{Listen, I can be straight with you, right? We don't like to talk about it much, but truth is, we're all pretty much peons here. Lifelong slaves, if you will. For protection and a place to live, we have to pay taxes we can't afford.}
{319}{}{Okay, go on...}
{320}{}{Without enough caps to go around, people sign up for 'peonage' contracts, basically renting themselves out for life.}
{321}{}{Sad to hear.}
{322}{}{Just as I thought.}
{323}{}{But it's not all bad. We are given free rein in everything that doesn't contradict the laws and interests of the Brotherhood of Steel. And we really do get reliable protection and help. After all, the Brotherhood needs food and a trade route. Without us, none of that would happen.}
{324}{}{And you're okay putting up with this situation?}
{325}{}{We have no choice! It was thanks to the Brotherhood and the Tinsmiths that we built such a beautiful town and grew such a crop. Without them, we would still be scratching out a miserable life as scavengers in the desert.}
{326}{}{It's true, the choices are tough. I don't know what I would choose in such a situation.}
{327}{}{It's hard for me to understand how you can trade freedom for life in a cage. You clearly made a mistake. Goodbye.}
{328}{}{I know your secret about the infection and its cover-up. And also - the pressure on residents and the rules, regulations, bans etc. Isn't this *your* tyranny if the Brotherhood has nothing to do with it?}
{329}{}{If you can't be a Deathclaw, might as well pretend to be a blind mole rat. Is that what you meant, weakling?}

{330}{}{Did you know your son's pet is dying?}
{331}{}{Yes... I'm already quite tired of this pig rat with his whining and fussing at night. I told Chipo that he shouldn't keep an animal in the house, but he doesn't listen to me. Now we have to put up with and fend off the complaints of our neighbors.}
{332}{}{What did Pinky do to all of you?}
{333}{}{Well... to be honest, nothing in particular, except for the rustling noises at night. His appearance is somewhat intimidating as well. And that's enough. If he were useful, perhaps the attitude towards Pinky would change.}
{334}{}{Interesting observation.}

{340}{}{The settlement of Santa Ana wants to start trading with you.}
{341}{}{Santa Ana? I haven't heard that name in years. The village used to avoid any contact with us. What changed?}
{342}{}{Well, let's just say there's been a change of leadership.}
{343}{}{Oh, now that sounds intriguing. I'll have to get a caravan ready. Maybe we can find some new hands from the people of Santa Ana, ones we often sorely lack. Thanks for passing on the message.}
{344}{}{You're welcome.}

{350}{}{You've got an interesting accent, Alvaro.}
{351}{}{I spoke Spanish my whole life. Only switched to English when I got older. Around here, that's not unusual.}
{352}{}{I see. Sorry if that question was out of line.}
{353}{}{No problem, it's funny anyway.}
{354}{}{«I understand you, friend. I understand.»}
{355}{}{Well, I'm glad we can understand each other. But that doesn't mean we're friends now. Around here, half the people understand at least a bit of Spanish... But it's good to hear my native tongue.}
{356}{}{Great. Now let's get down to business, if you don't mind.}
