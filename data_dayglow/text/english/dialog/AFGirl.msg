{100}{}{You see Thelma.}
{101}{}{You see a girl with a sad expression on her face.}
{102}{}{Good to see you.}
{103}{}{There's demons everywhere! Is this some kind of zombie apocalypse?}

#First dialogue
{200}{}{Hey, hi, wanderer. It's nice to see a new face in town. My name is Thelma Ferrino. How are you doing?}
{1200}{}{Hey, hi, wanderer. It's nice to see a new face in town. My name is Thelma Ferrino. How are you doing?}
{201}{}{Pretty good. How about you?}
{202}{}{I've had better days. But thanks for asking.}
{1202}{}{I've had better days. But thanks for asking.}
{203}{}{Why do you ask?}
{204}{}{Well, I just wanted to meet you. We rarely have guests. Especially now. It used to be busier here.}
{205}{}{What happened?}
{206}{}{Well, I'll tell you if you get me something cold from the bar.}
{207}{}{Okay, I'll get something now.}
{208}{}{No drinking, senorita. Adios.}
{209}{}{Here's 5 caps, get yourself one.}
{210}{}{Muchas gracias!}
{211}{}{Now tell me what's going on here.}
{212}{}{Well, you've already shared a drink. I think I owe you one.}
{1212}{}{Well, you've already shared a drink. I think I owe you one.}
{213}{}{You're still here... Which means maybe you like it here. Care to join me?}
{214}{}{Will you tell me about this settlement?}
{215}{}{What's going on here and why are you so sad?}

{220}{}{It's all because of that damn... 'platform' off the coast out there. It's been there since forever. The fishermen even used to rest there while fishing. That is, until some... monsters took over. And recently, poisonous muck has been leaking from the platform. Half the sea is probably dead because of it.}
{221}{}{Why does that upset you so much?}
{222}{}{Well, it's not that exactly. You see, when it got to be too much, my dad and other fishermen went to the platform. They knew it was dangerous. But something had to be done.}
{223}{}{What happened there?}
{224}{}{I just saw them go inside through my binoculars. Nothing has been heard from them since. I think they're all... dead. (takes a deep swig straight from the bottle)}
{225}{}{I'm sorry. You must have loved your dad a lot?}
{226}{}{Well, he was my dad. I... things will be tough without him. You know, I'd be happy if someone brought me his belongings as a keepsake.}
{227}{}{I don't think I'll ever be on that platform. Sorry, but you've got the wrong person.}
{228}{}{I'll keep that in mind. Cheer up, Thelma.}
{229}{}{}

{230}{}{Hey there, wanderer. Was it you who started that fire in the middle of the bay? That's pretty cool!}
{1230}{}{Hey there, wanderer. Was it you who set the sea on fire? That's pretty cool!}
{231}{}{Yep, that was me. The oil won't be a problem anymore, and neither will the 'floaters'.}
{232}{}{Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Did you happen to find any remains of our fishermen on the platform? One of them was my dad...}
{233}{}{No, sorry. They were probably eaten by the 'floaters'.}
{234}{}{I... I thought so. Well, okay. It's time we got over our grief and got down to business. Looks like we have a lot of work ahead of us...}
{235}{}{Right.}
{236}{}{I only found this tag among a pile of bones.}
{237}{}{That's his tag! Thank you so much, I'll treasure it.}
{238}{}{You're welcome.}
{239}{}{Not so fast. A reward is usually given for such deeds.}
{240}{}{Didn't think you'd say that. So, you helped us with the platform just for profit? Fine, here's my last hundred caps. Is that enough?}
{1240}{}{Didn't think you'd say that. So, you helped us with the platform just for profit? Fine, here's my last hundred caps. Is that enough?}
{241}{}{Enough. Bye.}
{242}{}{I found this tag among a pile of bones on the platform. It must have belonged to your dad.}
{243}{}{I just happened to be on the platform and found this tag there. It has your last name on it.}

{250}{}{Hello.}
{251}{}{Bye.}
{252}{}{Hello. Good to see you.}
