{100}{}{You see Marcos.}
{101}{}{You see Marcos.}
{102}{}{This day will go down in history.}

{200}{}{What did Matthias have to say? Is he gonna help us?}
{201}{}{I haven't been able to speak with him yet. Wait a little.}
{202}{}{Matthias promised to help. The operation can begin.}
{203}{}{Then let's get to work! Our goal is Aaron and his Advisor. Don't get distracted by the rest.}
{204}{}{Let's do it!}
{205}{}{He, uh, won't help us. We'll have to make do on your own.}
{206}{}{Too bad. I thought he was with us.}
{207}{}{You know, I have that feeling too. I'll try to convince him again...}
{208}{}{I don't think you should be counting on him. Let's do it without him.}
{209}{}{Matthias is dead. He won't be able to help us.}

{210}{}{Get back there with the others in the cathedral. Our goal is Aaron and his Advisor. Don't get distracted by anything else.}
{211}{}{Alright.}
{212}{}{Aaron and the Advisor are dead.}
{213}{}{We did it! This day will go down in history as the day of Phoenix's liberation. Phoenix, and the wasteland, thanks you.}
{214}{}{I hope your reign will be more just. Goodbye, Marcos.}
