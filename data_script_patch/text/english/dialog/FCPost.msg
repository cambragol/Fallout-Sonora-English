{100}{}{You see Anne Brandley.}
{101}{}{You see a rather unremarkable woman in business attire.}
{102}{}{Z-z-z...}
{103}{}{Sorry, we're closed. No one around here needs our services anymore...}

# Remarks when attacking a prisoner
{120}{}{Please calm down!}
{121}{}{My cash register is really empty!}
{122}{}{Don't touch anything here!}
{123}{}{Look, I really feel for you...}
{124}{}{I really can't help you!}
{125}{}{Please leave, I have nothing!}
{126}{}{Leave me alone!}
{127}{}{}
{128}{}{}
{129}{}{Help! I'm being robbed!}

# Dialogue
{200}{}{(you see a woman in an unusually decent outfit; she seems to take care of herself and looks down on those around her)}
{201}{}{Hello, Miss...}
{202}{}{Hello.}
{203}{}{Anne Brandley. And call me Mrs.}
{204}{}{As you say, Mrs. Brandley.}
{205}{}{(looks disdainfully) Hmm. Good afternoon. Where were you taught to talk to ladies like that? In a corn field?}
{206}{}{I wasn't taught how to talk to ladies at all.}

{210}{}{How can I help you?}
{211}{}{Goodbye.}
{212}{}{Let's go back to the beginning of the conversation.}
{213}{}{Let's go back a little.}

{218}{}{Thanks for the rescue! It was a dangerous situation. In gratitude, I'm gonna give you a big discount if our transportation services are needed.}
{219}{}{Sounds good.}

# Sending a package
{220}{}{I need to send a package to Phoenix.}
{221}{}{I need to send a package to Two-Sun.}
{222}{}{Wonderful. Shipping cost will be }
{223}{}{ caps. Place the package in this box near the wall and report it is ready. After payment, we will take it to Phoenix.}
{224}{}{Here's the fee, you can send the package.}
{225}{}{The package can wait. Let's talk about something else.}
{226}{}{I don't have that many caps with me. I'll come back later.}
{227}{}{(stumbling over every word, she draws up the contract and writes your name in the journal) Thank you for choosing our company. The package will be waiting at its destination.}
{228}{}{}
{229}{}{Wonderful. Goodbye.}
{230}{}{I'm sorry, but that's not enough.}
{231}{}{Should we talk about something else then?}
{232}{}{Well, I'll go collect the caps.}

{240}{}{Do you accept old money for payment?}
{241}{}{You mean pre-war dollars and cents? No, they have long been out of use. However, in Phoenix, the local casino can exchange them for caps, but only for their clients.}
{242}{}{Let's talk about my package.}
{243}{}{Hmm. This changes things. I'll hold off on sending it for now.}
{244}{}{I've got some heavy shipments coming south. We should cooperate.}
{245}{}{I'm afraid we can't offer discounts. This won't cover our shipping costs.}
{246}{}{Too bad.}
{247}{}{Sounds interesting. We can probably cut the price by 50 caps.}
{248}{}{You won't regret it.}
{249}{}{How reliable is this agreement?}

{250}{}{Are you sure you can... write?}
{251}{}{Better than most of the "literate" residents of the city. I took courses from the Followers of Fire... but I don't get enough practice.}
{252}{}{Uh, yeah, sure.}
{253}{}{We ship packages once a month. The cases of loss are few and far between. We have experienced couriers who know the terrain and survival techniques well. If the package is lost, you can claim compensation.}
{254}{}{OF COURSE I can write! Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to work here.}
{255}{}{Yeah, yeah, yeah.}

# Quest
{270}{}{I'm looking for a job. Do you have any vacancies?}
{271}{}{Unfortunately, no. To be honest, there is quite a line forming to guard our caravans.}
{272}{}{Too bad. I really need to earn some extra money.}
{273}{}{Are there really no jobs in this hole?}
{274}{}{Well then, could you do me a little favor? I recently lost my wallet. There were a few small things in it, but the most important was the notebook. Most likely it was stolen. If you find it, bring it to me, and I'll pay you.}
{275}{}{No problem. I have a nose for thieves.}
{276}{}{Oh, then your sense of smell will have to distinguish between hundreds of scents in this city. Good luck.}
{277}{}{Don't worry, lady. I'll find it without much difficulty.}
{278}{}{Not yet.}
{279}{}{It's a mess! And where are the soldiers from the garrison looking? Why do we pay taxes to these slackers?}

{280}{}{About your wallet and notebook...}
{281}{}{What is it? Did you find them?}
{282}{}{Just wondering if you had any ideas?}
{283}{}{I don't know. In the morning, my things were with me, but after a walk around the city, they disappeared. Maybe someone I passed saw something?}
{284}{}{Maybe, I'll check it out.}
{285}{}{I sure did. Here they are.}
{286}{}{Oh! You found them! I was afraid that I had lost them forever. You know, there's a lot of important information here for me. But who was the thief anyway?}
{287}{}{It was your neighbor's kids.}
{288}{}{Children? I can't believe it! Residents have always valued Flagstaff for its safety, with the garrison nearby and the impassable wall of barricades. And yet, the thieves were inside, not outside. And children too!}
{289}{}{Yes, it's just terrible. You can't trust anyone here.}
{290}{}{Of course, I won't report this to the garrison, but I won't easily forgive my neighbors either. Someone needs to keep order here.}
{291}{}{They're children. It wasn't really theft, just a simple prank.}
{292}{}{People who play such pranks end up in forced labor. Of course, I won't report this to the garrison, but I won't easily forgive my neighbors either.}
{293}{}{Actually, it looks like you dropped your things yourself. I found them on the street.}
{1293}{}{Actually, it looks like you dropped your things yourself. I found them on the street.}
{294}{}{Is that so? I find that a little hard to believe. But it doesn't matter now.}
{295}{}{It's good that your problem is solved.}
{296}{}{Ahem. The job is done, and the reward...}
{297}{}{Thank you very much. Here's 20 caps for finding my things.}
{298}{}{And thank you.}
{299}{}{Better than nothing.}

# Questions
{300}{}{What is this place?}
{301}{}{This is the Sonora Express office, the only delivery service in all of Arizona.}
{302}{}{So what are you delivering?}
{303}{}{We deliver small packages, transfers, and letters. For larger shipments, there's another company that works with the uranium mine.}
{304}{}{Unusual business around these parts.}
{305}{}{That's right. Previously, there was no need for packages and letters; many didn't even know how to write. But after the revolution in the south, a lot changed. The Sonora Express is one example.}
{306}{}{So what is this place?}
{307}{}{Are you here alone, without security?}
{308}{}{It's safe within the colony; raiders don't come here because of the garrison and patrolmen. But outside the valley, especially along the highways, there are more and more highwaymen.}
{309}{}{Why?}
{310}{}{Previously, along the route, there were only wolves and occasional tribes; the highwaymen had nothing to raid. Now, Flagstaff attracts people and caravans looking to earn money.}
{320}{}{Tell me about yourself.}
{321}{}{My name is Anne Brandley, and I own this office.}
{322}{}{Where are you from?}
{323}{}{I'm from the south, from Phoenix. I spent my entire childhood and youth there. Then I delivered packages and traded until I ended up at Sonora Express.}
{324}{}{What made you leave Phoenix?}
{325}{}{It's a large but stifling city where competition prevents business to expand. There, I lacked freedom, and security.}
{326}{}{Was it hard to get here?}
{327}{}{I arrived by caravan with the first settlers. The road was difficult -- we moved slowly because of all our baggage, there wasn't enough clean water, and we were attacked several times by hostile tribes. But back then, there weren't as many raiders on the way as there are now.}
{328}{}{Don't the mercenaries bother you?}
{329}{}{Soldiers in the garrison? Not at all. As long as my husband is one of them, this establishment is in no danger.}
{330}{}{Why do you call them soldiers?}
{331}{}{Well, they grew out of a gang of slave traders a long while back. Now, they're like a small army, protecting the city, with their own 'general' and all, like in those pre-war stories. However, you probably haven't read much.}
{332}{}{How do you like life in this town?}
{333}{}{Not bad if you accept the strict rules. I'm here more to earn money.}

{334}{}{Well, well... The Sonora Express. You guys get around.}

{350}{}{How do I get to Phoenix?}
{351}{}{Phoenix is a big city to the south, right here. (shows on the map) Just follow Route 17 without turning off.}
{352}{}{Can I join your messengers?}
{353}{}{We don't provide travel services; it's against company rules. It's worth talking to the uranium ore carriers; they sometimes need hired help.}
{354}{}{Great, I'll check them out when I have time.}
{355}{}{Thanks, I'll go see them right now.}
