#Dialogue
{200}{}{Oh, a visitor! Don't believe we've met before. What's your name?}
{201}{}{.}
{202}{}{Just a wastelander passing through.}
{203}{}{Well, pleased to meet you, }
{204}{}{. If you're in need of food or a place to rest, you should speak with the Rangers. Their base's down the road, a few hours walk.}
{205}{}{Nice to meet you... though you have a rather strange name}
{206}{}{Then why are you settled here?}
{207}{}{Seems like you're trying to shoo me off.}
{208}{}{Shoo you? Listen, this is a peaceful farm. And if you're thinking of causing trouble, remember, this is Ranger territory. And the Rangers don't take kindly to troublemakers...}
{209}{}{Alright, alright, got it.}
{210}{}{Good.}
{211}{}{But why live apart from the Rangers?}
{212}{}{Can't grow crops on rocks. And we prefer our own space.}
{213}{}{Mind if I fetch some water here?}
{214}{}{Got it. Won't bother you any longer.}
{215}{}{My husband wears the pants in this house. You'll need to talk to him.}
{220}{}{Ah, I remember you now.}
{221}{}{Goodbye.}
{222}{}{You'd best move on soon, lest the Rangers find you. They can be quite persistent when they want something.}
{1222}{}{You'd best move on soon, lest the Rangers find you. They can be quite persistent when they want something.}
