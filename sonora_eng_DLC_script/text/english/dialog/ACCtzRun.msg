{100}{}{You see Yang.}
{101}{}{You see a disheveled Mexican with a thick, scruffy beard.}

{110}{}{They exist!}
{111}{}{I'm telling the truth. Why you not believe Me?}
{112}{}{They'll get here someday!}
{113}{}{We must act now!}

#First dialogue
{200}{}{A huevo amigo! What wind brought you to these lands?}
{1200}{}{A huevo, amiga! What wind brought you to these lands?}
{201}{}{Well, I...}
{202}{}{Al tiro, amigo! Don't say a word! These amigos don't like strangers. They even look at me with a knife in their pocket.}
{1202}{}{Al tiro, amiga! Don't say a word! These amigos don't like strangers. They even look at me with a knife in their pocket.}
{203}{}{Why? Did something happen between you two?}
{204}{}{(looks around) Monstruos!}
{205}{}{You mean monsters?}
{206}{}{Monstrous! Giant leeches! Creepy disgusting and terribly smelly criaturas! They appear on the coast where I collect shellfish. But these tontos don't listen to me, they think I'm loco! But old Ian is not like that. Ian is no loco!}
{207}{}{They are making a big mistake by ignoring your words.}
{208}{}{Seems like you're really out of your mind, old man.}
{209}{}{Don't leave me alone, amigo. I need help!}
{1209}{}{Don't leave me alone, amigo. I need help!}
{210}{}{Okay. Where do you say they made their lair?}
{211}{}{It's near the wrecked schooner, further along the shore. But be careful.}
{212}{}{I see. Bye.}

#Re-dialogue
{220}{}{Ola, amigo.}
{1220}{}{Ola, amiga.}
{221}{}{Adios, Jan.}

{230}{}{Who's in charge here?}
{231}{}{Hector. Our old captain.}
{232}{}{Why do you call him captain?}
{233}{}{We came here on a schooner, and Hector was the captain. Since then it has become a custom to call him that.}
{234}{}{Interesting story. Tell me something else.}
{235}{}{Now I understand. Bye.}
{236}{}{Who are you?}
{237}{}{My name is Ian. I live nearby and collect shellfish on the coast.}
{238}{}{How do you know English, Ian?}
{239}{}{My family spoke two languages. This has been the case since ancient times.}
{240}{}{Interesting story. Tell me something else.}
{241}{}{Now I understand. Bye.}
{242}{}{Why won't your people help you?}
{243}{}{They don't believe me! They think I'm a fool!}
{244}{}{Don't worry so much. I just want to know more about you and this settlement.}
{245}{}{Not very nice of them. Maybe we can talk about this later.}
