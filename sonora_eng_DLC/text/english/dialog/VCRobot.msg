{100}{}{You see Senor Handy.}
{101}{}{You see a robot from the "Senor Handy" series.}

# First dialogue
{200}{}{Ah, finally! I haven't seen a living human being for a long time. Decades of solitude leave their mark even on *my* neural connections... Who are you? Tell me about yourself.}
{201}{}{I'm }
{202}{}{ from Villa. But who are you... or WHAT are you?}
{203}{}{Lo siento, mi joven descendiente. Technically, I'm a machine from the Old World. But more importantly, I carry the persona of Felix Tejada, your direct ancestor. Don't be surprised, great-great-grandchild. There used to be many robots like me all across the continent.}
{204}{}{This is amazing!}
{205}{}{You probably have a lot of questions. I can answer them and in turn you can answer mine.}
{206}{}{I actually have some questions for you, Mister Robot.}
{207}{}{I need to look around first. Let's talk later.}

{208}{}{«I'm sorry, my young descendant.» Technically, I'm a machine from the Old World. But more importantly, I carry the persona of Felix Tejada, your direct ancestor. Don't be surprised, great-great-grandchild. There used to be many robots like me all across the continent.}


{210}{}{Ah! How nice it is to see the light of the sun again.}
{211}{}{Nice to see you, great-great-grandson. Let me take a closer look at your face.}
{1211}{}{Nice to see you, great-great-granddaughter. Let me take a closer look at your face.}
{212}{}{End communication mode.}
{213}{}{Answer a few questions, robot.}
{214}{}{What do you want to know, my dear grandson?}
{1214}{}{What do you want to know, my dear granddaughter?}
{215}{}{That was all the questions I had.}
{216}{}{I have another question.}
{217}{}{Awaiting instructions.}
{218}{}{How sad... And I told the Overseer that living in the vault was no longer possible.}
{219}{}{I'm increasingly surprised by people's willingness to go all the way up their ass looking for trouble. That's what we're here for, isn't it?}

{220}{}{Why are they hiding you here?}
{221}{}{My last command before I died was to hide all ancient techologies. When I brought my community to the promised land, Old World items helped us survive. But time passed, and technology began to fail.}
{222}{}{Continue.}
{223}{}{There was nothing to repair them with, no place to find replacements or sources of energy. It would've been necessary to search for the necessary parts in dangerous irradiated ruins, and such travails would have had terrible consequenses for the health of the inhabitants. Moreover, over time, people lost their knowledge of the Old World, and ignorance leads to sad mistakes.}
{224}{}{I'm listening.}
{225}{}{I decided to protect future descendants from taking dangerous paths and banned all ancient, electronic technologies. And looking at you, I now understand that this decision saved the life of the community.}
{226}{}{Interesting line of thought.}
{227}{}{What is this place?}
{228}{}{The crypt? It appears that before the Great War there was an illegal fuel waste dump here. Or just some kind of bunker. In any case, we were able to hide from the dust storms here until the Villa came into its own.}
{229}{}{I see.}
{230}{}{Tell me how Villa came to be.}
{231}{}{It's a long and sad story... To be honest, I don't know everything myself. There must have been something Felix didn't want to talk about. But one thing is clear - it has something to do with Vault 27 near Phoenix.}
{232}{}{Curious.}

{233}{}{What should I call you? You're... just a robot.}
{234}{}{Call me Felix, baby. Is this too exciting for you? Well, you're right. In that case, Senor Handy is the nickname your ancestor gave me.}
{235}{}{I'll just call you robot.}
{236}{}{Okay, you'll be my assistant then.}
{237}{}{As you say, great-great-grandpa Felix.}

{240}{}{Would you like to travel with me?}
{241}{}{Of course, dear great-great-grandson! It's time to stretch those old bones. I hope you don't run too fast!}
{1241}{}{Of course, dear great-great-granddaughter! It's time to stretch those old bones. I hope you don't run too fast!}
{242}{}{Let's go, grandpa!}
{243}{}{Your assistant is ready to follow his master.}
{244}{}{Follow me, robot.}
{245}{}{Stay here and await further instructions.}
{246}{}{Grandpa will wait. Don't worry about me, grandchild.}
{247}{}{Be a good doggy and don't wet yourself, old man.}
{248}{}{Command accepted. I will hold my position until further notice.}
{249}{}{Just wait for me, robot.}
{250}{}{Switch to protocol dialogue mode.}
{251}{}{Turn on personalized dialogue mode.}
{252}{}{Speech personalization disabled.}
{253}{}{That's better.}
{254}{}{Phew, man! Well, you made this old robot move its brains. What's next?}
{1254}{}{Phew, baby! Well, you made this old robot move its brains. What's next?}
{255}{}{Welcome back, Grandpa.}
{256}{}{Put your weapon away immediately.}
