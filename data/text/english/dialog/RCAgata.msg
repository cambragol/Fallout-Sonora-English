{100}{}{You see Ranger Agatha.}
{101}{}{You see a seasoned ranger clad in battle armor.}
{102}{}{Impressive armor. Almost makes me envious.}

#First dialogue
{200}{}{Civilians aren't meant to wander around the base aimlessly. Got a question? Head to the information center. It's that building by the road.}
{201}{}{Got it.}
{202}{}{At ease, Ranger. Good to see you in the base. Any inquiries, feel free to ask.}
{203}{}{Thanks, captain.}
{204}{}{Attention, Ranger! Follow protocol or find your way out. I ain't got time for someone like you.}
{205}{}{Seems like my reputation gets under your skin. Care to chat?}
{206}{}{(You see a formidable woman in combat gear. Her stern military demeanor is accentuated by a cropped, stiff haircut and a rugged voice)}
{207}{}{Can I ask you a question?}

#Re-dialogue
{210}{}{Well, what is it wanderer?}
{1210}{}{What's on your mind, wanderer?}
{211}{}{What's up, Ranger?}
{212}{}{Later.}

{213}{}{Hmm... (eyes your ghoul appearance with confusion) You... sick or something? Don't go spreading whatever you've got around here.}
{214}{}{No need to worry about that.}

{220}{}{So you're the one who got the cadets all riled up with your bike, huh? Where'd you get it?}
{1220}{}{So you're the one who got the cadets all riled up with your bike, huh? Where'd you get it?}
{221}{}{It's a trophy.}
{222}{}{A trophy earned in battle deserves respect. (proudly adjusts armor)}
{223}{}{I figured you'd appreciate it.}
{224}{}{It was a gift.}
{225}{}{If you say so, gotta take your word for it.}
{226}{}{Yeah.}
{227}{}{You wouldn't mind taking a ride with me, would you, sweetheart?}

#Questions
{230}{}{Can I ask you a few questions?}
{231}{}{Name's Agata. I oversee the training team.}
{232}{}{}
{233}{}{}
{234}{}{It seems like the Rangers are like family to you, and the Cadets are your kids.}
{235}{}{You could say that. But personal motives don't matter much when duty calls.}
{236}{}{Can I ask you about something else?}
{237}{}{Where did you get that combat armor?}
{238}{}{Trophy from a combat op. Had to repaint it, so I wouldn't be mistaken for an enemy.}
{239}{}{What do those stripes mean?}
{240}{}{Veteran service, kid. When a Ranger has been dispensing justice in the Wasteland long enough, they get this mark of distinction. I've earned mine over many years.}
{241}{}{What do you do here?}
{242}{}{Lately, I've been running basic training for the cadets.}
{243}{}{A veteran dealing with rookies?}
{244}{}{I've done my share of fighting. Time to pass on the skills to the young ones.}
{245}{}{Why did you shave all the cadets' heads?}
{246}{}{So folks like you would ask. And to curb the young ones' vanity.}
{247}{}{Mental discipline? I get it.}
{248}{}{No, not discipline. Instilling resilience and self-control. Plus, it's good for hygiene.}
{249}{}{Okay, no argument here.}

#Education
{250}{}{Can I get some training?}
{251}{}{Thinking I should hand you a minigun right off the bat? We train our own cadets. Don't see you on the list.}
{252}{}{Let's change that.}
{253}{}{Not only can you, but you must. Though I've been informed about your special status. We'll have to conduct an expedited basic training course.}
{254}{}{I'm ready for the course.}
{255}{}{Got it, but training's on hold for now. Other duties call.}
{256}{}{Alright, let's start with the basics of survival. Every ranger needs 'em.}
{257}{}{Got it.}
{258}{}{Next up, weapon skills. We'll cover a bit of everything, but every ranger's got their preferences. What'll it be?}
{259}{}{}
{260}{}{Revolvers (small guns).}
{261}{}{Sniping (big guns).}
{262}{}{Ranger Throw (throwing).}
{263}{}{Improvised Combat (unarmed).}
{264}{}{Knife Fighting (melee weapons).}
{265}{}{Alright, Ranger! Move it to the drill yard! Let's see what you've got.}  
{266}{}{Let's do it!}

#Personal Story
{270}{}{How did you become a ranger?}
{271}{}{Tell me about how you became a ranger.}
{272}{}{I'm not exactly the open book type.}
{273}{}{Got it, no problem.}
{1273}{}{Got it, no problem.}
{274}{}{Still, I'm curious.}
{275}{}{Interested, huh? Well, it's an old tale. I was just a kid when raiders hit our camp...}
{276}{}{Go on.}
{277}{}{Eh, not now, maybe later.}
{278}{}{Managed to slip into the ruins and wait out the attack. When the dust settled, there was no one left.}
{279}{}{That's tough.}
{280}{}{Survival instinct kicked in, huh?}
{281}{}{At first, I was lost. Then I got mad and swore I'd avenge my family.}
{282}{}{Did you get your revenge?}
{283}{}{Taking on a whole gang? That's gutsy.}
{284}{}{Spent time honing my skills, scavenging, scouting, and eventually took 'em out one by one. Took a while.}
{285}{}{Impressive, using your wits to outsmart 'em.}
{286}{}{Tricks are for cowards. But hey, you were just a kid...}
{287}{}{But after all that blood, I realized the Wasteland needed more than a lone gun. It needed order. Rangers were the only ones who got that. After the raider business, I joined up without hesitation.}
{288}{}{That's quite the story.}
{289}{}{A familiar story. Someone I knew also hid from raiders. The community never forgave him for that.}

# Cadet Presley
{300}{}{Why won't you let Cadet Presley go on missions?}
{301}{}{He took a rifle from the warehouse! And even if he's ready to hold a rifle, he needs to be knocked down a peg. That goes for many cadets.}
{302}{}{So, he's too headstrong?}
{303}{}{More like ambitious and impatient. Rangers like that don't last long and usually meet a bad end.}
{304}{}{Maybe you're just being too hard on him?}
{305}{}{And what, should I coddle him? That's not how you turn teens into warriors. If he can't handle this pressure, he's not cut out to be a full-fledged Ranger.}
{306}{}{Why not give him a chance to prove himself?}
{307}{}{I'd let him go so he can get a dose of reality. But I can't reverse the decision in front of the other cadets without losing respect. Understand?}
{308}{}{You know best how to train cadets. I'll be off then.}
{309}{}{You know, maybe I could take cadet Preley out, under the guise of an escort.}
{310}{}{I don't see why you're sticking your nose in, but... maybe it's for the best. I'll assign Presley to escort you and make sure he gets his gear back.}
{311}{}{Great, I'll go tell him the good news.}
{312}{}{That's more like it.}
{313}{}{Where's Cadet Presley? You were the last one to see him.}
{1313}{}{Where's Cadet Presley? You were the last one to see her.}
{314}{}{He died in the line of duty.}
{315}{}{Damn it! Why did I trust an idiot like you! Get out of my sight before I lose my temper!}
{1315}{}{Damn it! Why did I trust an idiot like you! Get out of my sight before I lose my temper!}
{316}{}{Um...}

{320}{}{Did you know the quartermaster's missing some weapons from the armory?}
{321}{}{Yes. And of course, you're trying to sort out this mess, right? But you know what, that pack rat needs to clean up his dusty old storeroom. Because I don't believe for a second my cadets stole anything.}
{322}{}{[Continue]}
{323}{}{And I won't let anyone accuse them. Got it? Now, I need to get back to training.}
{324}{}{Of course, no problem.}
{325}{}{Yeah, sure.}
