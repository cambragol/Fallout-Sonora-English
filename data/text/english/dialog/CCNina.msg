{204}{}{Mi nombre es Lucia.}
{205}{}{Lucia, then. What special outfit are you wearing? Is this holiday really in your honor? }
{206}{}{Hoy sere reina. Este es un gran honor para mi... (hides her excited gaze) Dime sinceramente, te gusta nuestra ciudad?}
{207}{}{I don't understand, are you happy or crying?}
{208}{}{(covers face) Estoy bien.}
{209}{}{Okay, I'll go on having fun.}
{210}{}{«Hello. I also speak Spanish. Can I talk to you?»}
{211}{}{«My name is Lucia.»}
{212}{}{«You seem so shy, yet your outfit is quite impressive. Is this holiday really in your honor?»}

{221}{}{«I don't understand, are you laughing at me or crying?»}
{222}{}{«Do you know where your crown might have gone?»}
{223}{}{«Is it missing? Oh, this is bad... find it, please! I must go through the ceremony, otherwise the saint will be angry!»}
