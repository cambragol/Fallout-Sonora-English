{100}{}{You see Iron Mike.}
{101}{}{You see a once formidable fighter, now weathered by time and battle.}
{102}{}{What do you want? I don't talk to cowards who hide behind Power Armor.}
{103}{}{Someone killed Angelo. I swear I'll find that bastard and break his neck.}
{104}{}{Another junkie... The exit's that way. I said, THE EXIT'S THAT WAY.}
{105}{}{No thanks, buddy. I want nothing to do with the Cardinals.}

#First Dialogue 1
{200}{}{(As you enter the dim, musty room, the stench of alcohol and decay assaults your senses. You notice a figure in a tattered chair making a sudden move and yelling, "Hey, get out of my room!" before hurling a bottle at you.)}
{201}{}{What's your problem, you son of a bitch?!}
{202}{}{Sorry, didn't mean to disturb you...}
{1202}{}{Sorry, didn't mean to disturb you...}
{203}{}{(You see a strong, bald man with dull fighting tattoos covering his arms. He's glaring at you from his chair.) I don't want to see anyone. Get out!}
{204}{}{Alright, whatever you say...}
{205}{}{Don't think I'm just gonna let this go.}
{206}{}{Go away. I don't want to see anyone.}
{207}{}{Can we talk?}
{208}{}{Didn't get it the first time? Get out!}
{209}{}{I just...}

#First Dialogue 2
{210}{}{Sorry for yelling. Sometimes I can't help myself, especially after the second bottle of tequila.}
{211}{}{I get it.}
{212}{}{Next time I might throw the bottle back.}
{213}{}{Name's Mike. Some call me Iron Mike, because nobody ever beat me in the ring. But you know what? Screw them! I'm done with those fights. People fight for caps, but I fought to be the best. It's not the same thing.}
{214}{}{If you don't fight anymore, what do you do?}
{215}{}{(He downs the rest of his bottle and sighs.) I drink! And I reminisce. Sure, I could still make some money training, but I don't want to. This city's a cesspool... Are you even listening?}
{216}{}{Yeah, uh, a cesspool. What do you mean?}
{217}{}{Hey, leave me a sip, will ya?}
{218}{}{I used to train young fighters in street combat. But they always went off to join gangs or work for crime bosses. I don't train anyone anymore. I drink, and everyone's happy.}
{219}{}{That doesn't sound like much fun.}
{220}{}{You're a washed-up loser.}
{221}{}{All these revolutionaries, cultists, gangsters, and black marketeers - they only care about themselves. Nobody gives a damn about you or the city. So, what brings you here?}
{222}{}{Just trying to meet people. I'm new in town.}
{223}{}{(He scratches his stubble and looks at you indifferently) You picked a lousy place for that, kid. But a good fight in the ring might get you noticed.}
{224}{}{Really? Great idea. I was thinking of trying that.}
{225}{}{Actually, I'm looking for my family. They were kidnapped by slavers.}
{226}{}{Sorry, I don't get involved in that kind of stuff. But I've heard the fire worshippers are tied to the slavers. Be careful, it's a dangerous path.}
{227}{}{Thanks, Mike. I guess it's time to talk to these fire worshippers.}
{228}{}{I want to learn how to fight.}
{229}{}{I told you, I'm done with training.}
{230}{}{That's a shame to hear.}

{240}{}{Tell me about the arena.}
{241}{}{Angelo Rossitto runs it. He's a decent guy, knows how to keep things running. But sometimes, you just want to flush him down the toilet.}
{242}{}{Tell me about your victories in the ring.}
{243}{}{I won every fight. The streets taught me how to fight, and relentless training honed my skills. I even learned some techniques from old books and movies.}
{244}{}{Movies?}
{245}{}{Yeah. Some scavengers found a working projector and old films. It was the only real entertainment back then. But the theater didn't last long. The owner was killed by raiders, and the projector vanished.}

{250}{}{Ah, the new champion. (He looks you over with a critical eye.) Honestly, I wouldn't put you in the ring, but Angelo doesn't have much choice. Enjoy your win, and get out of my room.}
{251}{}{Hmph. I'm outta here.}
{252}{}{You're just jealous. Stay in your hole, you drunk.}
{253}{}{Ah, the new champion. Looks like our training paid off. Use those skills for good.}
{254}{}{Don't worry, Mike. See you around.}
{255}{}{Ah, the new champion. (He looks you over again, sizing you up.) I don't get why you're in the fights, but at least you seem like a decent guy. (raises his bottle) Cheers.}
{256}{}{Later.}

{260}{}{Angelo told me about your tragedy. Can you tell me about it?}
{261}{}{I'm not like that, Mike. I won't hurt anyone unless they truly deserve it.}
{1261}{}{I'm not like that, Mike. I won't hurt anyone unless they truly deserve it.}
{262}{}{Temptation's a harsh teacher. You don't realize it until you're standing at a crossroads. I've learned that lesson the hard way.}
{263}{}{Did something happen?}
{264}{}{You're talking like something awful already happened. What is it?}
{265}{}{I'll pay, Mike. How much for a lesson?}
{266}{}{Caps. Of course. Now those worthless rattles rule everything. But I'm done selling the right to violence, if you get my drift.}
{267}{}{Want to hear it? (sigh) Alright, listen. I used to train anyone willing to pay. I didn't care where they ended up. Some joined gangs, others turned to thieving. I ignored it... until one day...}
{268}{}{Go on.}
{269}{}{Typical. Never thinking about the consequences of you actions.}
{270}{}{One night, I was walking my girlfriend, Sabrina, home. We were jumped by thugs. I fought them off, but I couldn't save Sabrina. She... she was killed. During the fight, I recognized my own students among the attackers.}
{271}{}{What happened to them?}
{272}{}{I hope you left them bleeding in the dirt.}
{273}{}{After that night, they went underground, joining gangs for protection. I couldn't get to them. But gangsters don't live long. Only one's left now, working as security at a casino. If I lay a hand on him, Don Diego's whole clan will come down on me. So, I drown my sorrow in tequila, the same stuff that casino serves.}
{274}{}{That's rough. Now I understand why you won't teach me. Goodbye, Mike.}
{275}{}{I'll avenge you, Mike. I'll get justice.}
{276}{}{You think that'll comfort me? No. I just want to look him in the eye, alone.}
{277}{}{So they became common thugs?}
{278}{}{What were you thinking, teaching those idiots?}
{279}{}{Is this about what happened to Sabrina?}
{280}{}{Tell me more about that attack.}
{281}{}{I don't want to discuss it. Only one attacker's left alive, working at a casino.}
{282}{}{Alright, forget it.}
{283}{}{I think you should know, he had an "accident." Satisfied?}
{284}{}{Partly. Though I'm not sure what I'd do in your place...}
{285}{}{Thugs don't last long. I won't add to their numbers. All I can do is lose myself in tequila. I drink, I don't hurt anyone, and everyone's happy.}
{286}{}{It's a sad tale, Mike. Now I get why you won't teach me.}
{287}{}{Come back when you're a saint radiating peace and kindness. Then I might teach you everything I know.}
{288}{}{Alright. I'll prove you can trust me.}
{289}{}{I doubt I can change this city for the better. Goodbye, Mike.}
{290}{}{Still against training me?}
{291}{}{I've heard about the good you do for these slums. Why? Why care about these poor souls?}
{292}{}{I can't stand injustice.}
{293}{}{I've heard about your deeds in this god-forsaken city. Why? What's in it for you?}
{294}{}{They say you're a hero, even outside this city. Helping people of the wasteland. Why? What drives you?}
{1294}{}{They say you're a savior for the poor and oppressed, even beyond this city. Why? Why do you do it?}
{295}{}{You know, I like you. I don't know why, but your presence lifts my spirits. I don't want you to end up like Sabrina or worse.}
{296}{}{Will you teach me?}

#Workout
{300}{}{Come in. But if I don't like something, you'll be out on the street.}
{301}{}{Come in, friend. Brought more drinks?}
{1301}{}{Come in, kid. Got more drinks?}
{302}{}{Make yourself comfortable.}
{303}{}{I've got nothing more to teach you. Train yourself. I believe in you.}
{309}{}{See you, Mike.}

{310}{}{Teach me how to fight, coach.}
{311}{}{Teach a woman? Never done that. But they say women fought in the Great War. At least, that's what the old posters say.}
{312}{}{There you go.}
{313}{}{I've already said, I'm not training anyone.}
{314}{}{But why?}
{315}{}{You might use what you learn to rob people on the streets. Become a thug. Many did. I won't make that mistake again.}
{316}{}{No point arguing with you. Bye, Mike.}
{317}{}{I'll pay.}
{318}{}{Caps. Naturally. These days, caps settle everything. But tell me first, what do you plan to use these skills for? Self-defense? Making money in the ring? Promise me, swear right now... No, SWEAR you'll use these skills for the good of ordinary people.}
{319}{}{I can't make that promise.}
{320}{}{Well then. We've got nothing more to talk about. Leave.}
{321}{}{Okay.}
{322}{}{I swear, Mike. I won't let you down.}
{323}{}{Caps. Of course. But I'm not wasting my time on someone like you. Get out.}
{324}{}{Alright.}
{325}{}{Hmm... Not sure... Give me time to think. And bring more drinks.}
{326}{}{Alright.}
{327}{}{So, have you decided? Will you train me?}
{328}{}{Maybe I've been wrong all these years... Fine. Each session will cost you 500 caps. Save up and come back.}
{329}{}{See you later, Mike.}
{330}{}{Maybe I've been wrong all these years... Fine. Prepare for training and come back tomorrow morning.}
{331}{}{I'll be here, Mike.}

{332}{}{(disdainful) I knew you couldn't be trusted. You swore you'd use your skills for good. Now I don't believe a word you say. Get lost.}
{333}{}{Uh...}
{334}{}{Get out of my sight. You're a disgrace.}
{335}{}{Fine, forget it.}

{340}{}{I'm here to learn the art of hand to hand combat.}
{341}{}{Sounds a bit dramatic, but fine. Got 500 caps?}
{1341}{}{Sounds a bit dramatic, but alright. Got 500 caps?}
{342}{}{No, I didn't think of that, sorry.}
{1342}{}{No, I didn't think about that, sorry.}
{343}{}{I might teach you for free, but when you pay, you value it more.}
{344}{}{Yeah, of course.}
{345}{}{Here's the caps. What's on the agenda today?}
{346}{}{Sounds good. And keep the caps. Today's training is on me. Just because I like you.}
{347}{}{Great. What's on the schedule today?}
{348}{}{I've heard rumors you were involved in killing children. I'm not sure if it's true, but I trust my source. From now on, you're no longer my student. Leave.}
{1348}{}{I've heard you're tied to child murders. I don't know if it's true, but I don't want to find out. From now on, you're not welcome here. Get out.}
{349}{}{...}

{350}{}{Let's start with the basics. Stance, breathing, and focus.}
{351}{}{Time for action. Practice basic strikes and grappling.}
{352}{}{You've learned a lot. Starting now, we'll push harder. Focusing on endurance and fighting armed opponents.}
{1352}{}{You've learned a lot. From now on, training gets tougher. Endurance and handling armed opponents.}
{353}{}{You've learned a lot. The most important lesson left is self-care. Maintaining balance and control in critical situations could save your life one day.}
{354}{}{[Start training]}
{355}{}{We're too worn out. Come back in a day or so.}
{356}{}{Alright, coach.}
