{100}{}{You see Beatriz.}
{101}{}{You see a ghoul in what was once a beautiful dress.}
{102}{}{}
{103}{}{See that handsome guy behind the counter? He makes some great eggs... Oh, I hope you get what I mean.}
{104}{}{Hey, what happened to Jose? He's not going to just abandon us on this stage!}
{105}{}{I'm so happy! I'm so happy!}

{200}{}{Hey there, handsome. You've stirred up quite the commotion by showing up. How's it going?}
{1200}{}{Hello. You've stirred up quite the commotion yourself. What do you need?}
{201}{}{Goodbye.}
{202}{}{Who are you?}
{203}{}{Who am I? I'm Beatriz Aguirre! My name used to be on every marquee in California. Ah, how times have changed.}
{204}{}{What are you doing here?}
{205}{}{That handsome guy at the bar promised me a drink. It's the only comfort in my damned life.}
{206}{}{I've been sent by Jose Solis. He's trying to get his mariachi band back together.}
{207}{}{So the old man is back at it again? Excting! Alright, I'm in. Let's see where this goes.}
{208}{}{I'll come back for you and we'll head to Old Town together. Goodbye.}
{209}{}{He wants me to take you straight to Old Town. Can you go now?}
{210}{}{Let's go! Into the limelight again!}
{211}{}{Yes, let's go.}
{212}{}{I can hardly wait to perform on stage again! Will you help me get to Old Town?}
{213}{}{Yes, let's go.}
{214}{}{Not now.}
{215}{}{I'm burning with desire to perform on stage again!}
{216}{}{We'll get back to this later, Beatriz.}
{217}{}{Come with me. The stage is waiting for you in Old Town.}
{218}{}{Wait here. I'll be back soon.}
{219}{}{Thanks for the help. I'll sing a sad song in your honor.}
{220}{}{Good luck on stage.}
