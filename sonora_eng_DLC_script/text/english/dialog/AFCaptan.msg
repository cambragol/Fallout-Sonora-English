{100}{}{You see Gilberto.}
{101}{}{You see a man with a bushy mustache. He is wearing a captain's cap.}
{102}{}{Please help! The reavers have attacked the village!}
{103}{}{Reavers! Hide!}
{104}{}{It's the reavers! Run!}
{105}{}{Reavers have attacked the village!}
{106}{}{Save yourself if you can! Reavers are everywhere!}
{107}{}{Hey, get off the table! It's not funny.}

{200}{}{Hello. My name is Gilberto. I run the 'Old Lighthouse' bar over there. What brings you to our harbor?}
{201}{}{Hi, Gilberto. I'm just passing through here, looking for a place to stay.}
{202}{}{Passing through? You must have a few tales to tell. Tell me about them sometime. In the meantime, you can stay in the village, but be careful - we've been on edge lately.}
{203}{}{Then I'll take a look around, if you don't mind. See you.}
{204}{}{Why, what happened?}
{205}{}{What's going on here?}
{206}{}{I'm on a mission for the Brotherhood of Steel. It doesn't concern you.}
{207}{}{Then welcome! But be careful - we've been on edge lately.}
{208}{}{I'll take a look around, if you don't mind. See you.}
{209}{}{What did you warn me against?}

{210}{}{How can I help you?}
{211}{}{Good to see you.}
{212}{}{How long are you going to hang around here?}
{213}{}{See you, Gilberto.}

{220}{}{Can you tell me about this place?}
{221}{}{Some people call it 'El Faro Pier'. We're just a simple fishing village though. We took over the old pier and repaired several boats so we could fish. That's all.}
{222}{}{Yourselves? You just came and fixed it? Hard to believe a bunch of fishermen know their way around old tech.}
{223}{}{I see.}
{224}{}{Well, not exactly. We're under the protection of the order based in Puerto Penasco. In exchange for seafood, they supply us with everything we need.}
{225}{}{Can you tell me more about the platform?}
{226}{}{A man-made structure in the middle of the sea. It has been there since time immemorial.}
{227}{}{Why was it built?}
{228}{}{Seems they were getting oil from the seabed. But I don't know what it's for. Though it burns quite nicely.}
{229}{}{Got it. That's all I wanted to know.}
{230}{}{How can I get there?}
{231}{}{By boat, of course. Ask the fishermen on the pier.}
{232}{}{Where is Puerto Penasco?}
{233}{}{Somewhere 50 miles south. Walk along the shore, you won't miss it.}

{250}{}{We are facing a disaster. It's as if the sea itself is punishing fishermen and peasants for the mistakes of our ancestors!}
{251}{}{What are you talking about?}
{252}{}{Take a closer look out to sea. See that platform on the horizon? Looks like some black, oily muck is leaking right into the water from it, right? It smells awful, and the sea life around here is dying off at like crazy because of it. This has happened before, but lately, it's become too much.}
{253}{}{Is it that bad?}
{254}{}{At first we were happy to see the coastline littered with fish - just come and take as much as you want. But all these dead fish are poisoned. Some of our people still suffer from eating it. And I'm not sure if they'll recover.}
{255}{}{What kind of poison is this?}
{256}{}{I think this is what they used to call "oil" and it came from the bottom of the sea. But I'm not sure what it is. In any case, the leak must be stopped. We will pay 1000 caps to whoever goes to the platform and stops the leak.}
{257}{}{So what's the problem?}
{258}{}{We've been avoiding the platform for a long time. Some floating mutant... things, have built their nest there and attack anyone who approaches it. Several fishermen have already tried to fight their way there. Some returned, others died. But if we don't stop the leak, we won't have anything to eat.}
{259}{}{I'll think about your offer. But I'll need a boat.}
{260}{}{That sounds like quite the task to me. I can't even swim! Good luck finding someone.}
{261}{}{Thanks. You give me hope. And about a boat, talk to the fishermen on the pier.}
{262}{}{Okay.}
{263}{}{What about the Brotherhood of Steel? Why not ask them for help?}
{264}{}{Brotherhood? Ha! They would rather have their hands cut off than allow ancient technologies to be destroyed. I think the Brotherhood hopes to restore this platform. But until they sort out the problems in the east, he won't have enough strength to deal with the platform. That is, we'll have to wait a long time for their help.}
{265}{}{I see.}

{270}{}{All the sick have recovered. The poison no longer affects them.}
{271}{}{Thank you on behalf of the entire village!}
{272}{}{You're welcome.}
{273}{}{You don't think it was free, do you?}
{274}{}{Did we agree on payment? However, you probably used some medicine. Here, take 40 caps for each patient. Thanks again.}
{1274}{}{Did we agree on payment? However, you probably used some medicine. Here, take 40 caps for each patient. Thanks again.}
{275}{}{Well, that's another matter.}

{280}{}{Viva! You did it! The whole village was watching you from the shore. Now the sea will become more merciful to us. Thank you, amigo. We are forever in your debt. Here are 1000 caps. We collected this reward for the person who solved our problem. It's yours now.}
{1280}{}{Viva! You did it! The whole village was watching you from the shore. Now the sea will become more merciful to us. Thank you, amiga. We are forever in your debt. Here are 1000 caps. We collected this reward for the person who solved our problem. It's yours now.}
{281}{}{Keep the caps for yourself. I did this not for the sake of caps, but for the sake of ordinary people who were in trouble. How my Villa once felt.}
{282}{}{You truly are an amazing person.}
{283}{}{Goodbye, Gilberto. It's time for me to go.}
{284}{}{Well, if you insist, I'll have to take these caps.}
{285}{}{Visit us again if you're in the area. You're always welcome here.}
{286}{}{Goodbye, Cap. It's time for me to go.}

{290}{}{Hey, you're coming from Puerto, right? We heard there was an explosion, and we've lost contact with the Brotherhood since.}
{291}{}{The Order's feeding six-eyed fish at the bottom of the sea now.}
{292}{}{I see... You didn't think much of them, did you? Honestly, we weren't too thrilled with them either, but they did help us in exchange for fish. Without them, it's going to be tough. Well, we had a good run for a while. Now it's back to surviving.}
{293}{}{I value freedom more than life under someone else's oppression. I hope you understand this now too.}
{294}{}{I didn't think about that. I'm really sorry this happened.}
{1294}{}{I didn't think about that. I'm really sorry this happened.}
{295}{}{Me? No, I wasn't there and I don't know shit about the explosion.}
{1295}{}{Me? No, I wasn't there and I don't know shit about the explosion.}
{296}{}{Really? Alright, I won't ask how you got here without passing through the only settlement on the way. I just want to say that if the Brotherhood is no more, things are going to get tough for us here. They used to help us in exchange for fish.}
{297}{}{I think now you'll get to experience the true joy of freedom. You'll like it.}
{298}{}{I'm really sorry it turned out this way.}
{299}{}{}

{300}{}{I'm heading to Inferno on a Brotherhood mission. What do you know about that place?}
{301}{}{It's a cursed place. That's why it's called Inferno.}
{302}{}{Have you been there?}
{303}{}{Not me, but some brave souls went there looking for useful stuff. The Brotherhood pays well for pre-war relics. But life is more precious, you know? The only one who went there and came back is the bartender. He should be at the bar right now. Talk to him.}
{304}{}{I'll talk to him once I'm done with you.}
{305}{}{Alright, thanks.}

{310}{}{The Brotherhood mentioned a settlement on the other shore. What do you know about it?}
{311}{}{We don't sail that far. But it could be true. Some have seen lights on the other shore through binoculars. If there are people living there, they must be suffering from loneliness.}
{312}{}{Looks like I'll have to go there myself to find out.}
{1312}{}{Looks like I'll have to go there myself to find out.}

{320}{}{Besides the platform, any other problems here?}
{321}{}{Well, someone is stealing fish catches and nets along the shore. I think it's some kind of beast from the wasteland. But we haven't been able to catch it yet. If you find out who or what's doing this, I'll pay 50 caps.}
{322}{}{Okay. I'll find this thief.}
{323}{}{That's too small. You'll have to find this fish lover yourself.}
{324}{}{I know what kind of creature was ravaging your nets.}
{325}{}{Really? What?}
{326}{}{It was a dead guy, like a ghoul. During the day he hid in the shadow of the lighthouse, and at night he went out to the beach in search of fish. Now he's deader than dead.}
{327}{}{Oh god...Could it be a demon, a...a reaver from Inferno? Oh, Holy Mary, that's the last thing we need!}
{328}{}{Inferno? What's that?}
{329}{}{Burnt ruins to the northwest. Those who have been there talk about people...ghouls... disfigured beyond recognition by radiation. That place turns people into demons and takes away their sanity. We avoid Inferno. But the reavers never came here either. They probably don't like the fresh sea air.}
{330}{}{However, this one somehow got here.}
{331}{}{Something must have forced him to leave his native ruins. I hope the others don't follow him. Oh yes, here's your 50 caps. Thank you.}
{332}{}{Good luck, Gilberto.}
{333}{}{Inferno? Yah, he was probably from there.}
{334}{}{Any small jobs to do?}
{335}{}{It was a dead guy, like a ghoul. During the day he hid in the shadow of the lighthouse, and at night he went out to the beach in search of fish. I managed to drive him away from the Black Lagoon.}
{336}{}{Something must have made him leave his haunts in the ruins. I hope the others don't follow him. But is this really true? I'm not ready to pay 50 caps for just words, sorry. Here's 10 caps and let's call it at that.}
{337}{}{I can understand. Thanks for the 10 caps.}
{338}{}{Bastard, you'll pay for your lies!}

{340}{}{What's new in this village?}
{341}{}{Not much good news. The Brotherhood of Steel is no longer with us. Something exploded on their ship, and now we are on our own. I don't know how we'll manage without them with all this old equipment.}
{342}{}{I see. Anything else?}
{343}{}{We're having trouble with the oil rig and the 'floaters'. A big problem. And no one can solve it yet.}
{344}{}{Things are looking up! The oil rig no longer pollutes the water. I think that in a few weeks the sea waters will begin to bless us with fresh fish again.}
{345}{}{But things have gotten much better at sea. }
{346}{}{Ruiz is obsessed with finding a treasure. Which doesn't exist. Hehe. Don't fall for his bait, amigo.}
{1346}{}{Ruiz is obsessed with finding a treasure. Which doesn't exist. Hehe. Don't fall for his bait, amiga.}
{347}{}{Ruiz has disappeared somewhere. And I don't want to look for him.}
{348}{}{It looks like Ruiz has finally found the treasure he's been looking for. Who would have thought that the treasure really existed?}
{349}{}{Sometimes the sea shows us strange things. One moment a monster emerges from the water, the next the far shore is lit up. But we don't usually venture that far out. Nothing to do there.}
{350}{}{It turns out that there was a whole settlement on the other side, and we didn't even know about it! Although the guys there don't seem particularly cheerful.}
{351}{}{Some saw a strange greenish glow from the direction of the destroyed lighthouse. But it's destroyed. Where does the light come from there?}
{352}{}{After we found that reaver...that, demon, near the lighthouse, people became afraid to walk in that direction. What if other demons come here from Inferno?}
{353}{}{There are no more stories. Our town is small and boring.}
{354}{}{Got it. Let's change the subject.}
{355}{}{Got it. Well, take care then.}
{356}{}{Lately, Ruiz has been pretty angry. I'm not sure what happened.}

{360}{}{Bad news. Someone strangled a teenager near the lighthouse.}
{361}{}{That's REALLY bad news! Let's head there right away...}
{362}{}{Alright.}
{363}{}{Hey, let's agree right now that I had nothing to do with this, okay?}
{364}{}{God, poor Johnny! Who could have done this?}
{365}{}{Tell me about Johnny.}
{366}{}{He moved here with his parents three years ago. They died at sea when their boat capsized. But Johnny didn't give up. He was such a good boy! He worked tirelessly to support himself.}
{367}{}{Does he have any relatives?}
{368}{}{Only Uncle Tin. He moved recently, because of an invitation letter that Johnny sent to Phoenix after the death of his parents. Tin-Tan is a little weird. He spends a lot of time on the shore, trying to catch fish, although there's only garbage floating here. I don't know how to tell him about what happened. As soon as the relatives united, fate separated them again. It's so sad.}
{369}{}{Any idea why he might have been killed?}
{370}{}{Well, Johnny didn't have any enemies. And there was no point in robbing him.}
{371}{}{What about the piece of rope that strangled him?}
{372}{}{Hmm, this is exactly the same rope that Ruiz uses in his craft. But this piece looks pretty fresh, like it just came out of storage.}
{373}{}{Well, this calls for a thorough investigation. Let's keep it under wraps for now to avoid tipping off the killer.}
{374}{}{I want to talk to you about Johnny's murder.}
{375}{}{Poor Johnny! So did you manage to find the killer?}
{376}{}{No new leads yet. See you later.}
{377}{}{Where were you during the murder?}
{378}{}{I was sleeping in my bar!}
{379}{}{Tell me about him.}
{380}{}{I talked to Johnny's uncle. He says that only Ruiz has such a rope.}
{381}{}{That doesn't prove anything. Though Ruiz is always angry, he has no motive for murder. You should talk to him too.}
{382}{}{Alright.}
{383}{}{According to Jose Rene Ruiz's records, the last person who bought his rope was Tin-Tan.}
{384}{}{That still doesn't prove anything. Tin-Tan is strange, but he's Johnny's uncle. He has no motive for murder. Talk to him too.}
{385}{}{Alright.}
{386}{}{It could be Jose Rene Ruiz. He has that rope. And Tin-Tan. He bought it recently.}
{387}{}{Well, that doesn't prove anything yet. Neither of them has a motive. But it's a start. Maybe someone at the bar knows something about their relationships with Johnny?}
{388}{}{Alright.}
{389}{}{The real killer is Tin-Tan.}
{390}{}{I remember our conversation. But what's his motive?}
{391}{}{Honestly, I don't know his motive. Maybe I should think about this again.}
{392}{}{He's not who he says he is. The real Johnny's uncle died during the trip, and he took his documents. He's a raider.}
{393}{}{So that's why he acted like an idiot-joker! He pretended to be a fool so no one would recognize him as a dangerous man. Cunning bastard!}
{394}{}{He got what he deserved after he tried to attack me.}
{395}{}{Wow! You've got nerves of steel. Thanks for the help. We don't need any scum around here. Life's tough enough without them.}
{396}{}{Hope things get easier for you now. Good luck.}
{397}{}{Things could've turned out worse, Cap. Goodbye.}
{398}{}{True. You need to catch him and bring him to justice as soon as possible.}
{399}{}{Thanks for the help. We don't need any scum around here. Life's tough enough without them.}
