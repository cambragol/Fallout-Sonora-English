{100}{}{You see the Lord of Phoenix.}
{101}{}{You see a stern man in ceremonial robes. His commanding gaze makes you uneasy.}
{102}{}{This is a peaceful church. Why such extreme security measures?}
{103}{}{You have officially relinquished your Ranger badge.}
{104}{}{You have officially become a Follower of Fire.}

# First dialogue (introduction)
{200}{}{How dare you enter these chambers unannounced! Who are you, and what do you want? In the name of the Holy Fire, speak quickly and clearly.}
{201}{}{I never expected to see you again. What is it this time?}
{202}{}{I just want to talk with you.}
{203}{}{I'd like to speak with you.}
{204}{}{My name is }
{205}{}{. And I represent the Villa community.}
{206}{}{I want to join the church, holy father.}

{210}{}{I seem to be lost. Can you tell me the way out?}
{1210}{}{I seem to be lost. Can you tell me the way out?}
{211}{}{How absurd. I will give you one more chance. WHAT do you want?}
{212}{}{I told you, I'm looking for the exit.}
{213}{}{You are either remarkably stupid or intentionally insolent. Guards! Seize this fool!}
{1213}{}{You are either remarkably stupid or intentionally insolent. Guards! Seize this fool!}
{214}{}{Who's the fool? Me?}
{215}{}{Just try to catch me!}
{216}{}{Wait! I don't want any trouble. Can't we settle this peacefully?}
{217}{}{Poor, wretched soul. Leave my sight. Your idiocy is pitiful. I hope a raider ends your pointless existence soon.}
{218}{}{Not a chance, old man.}
{219}{}{I'll find my way out.}

{220}{}{Very well. But we don't welcome quarrelsome visitors here. What do you want?}
{221}{}{Just a meeting with you. I have some questions.}
{222}{}{I'll be the one asking questions here. You will answer.}
{223}{}{I am an envoy of the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{224}{}{You test my patience... (an advisor whispers in his ear) Hmm. Fine. I won't detain you. But don't disturb me again without cause. Leave!}
{225}{}{Of course, Lord Aaron. Sorry for the disturbance.}
{226}{}{Alright.}
{227}{}{Villa? That place is unfamiliar to me. What do you want, }
{228}{}{ from the Villa?}
{229}{}{I need to speak with you regarding Villa, Lord Aaron.}

{230}{}{Enough! You will be publicly flogged and hanged! Seize the heretic!}
{1230}{}{Enough! You will be publicly flogged and hanged! Seize the heretic!}
{231}{}{That's it! Time to die tyrant!}
{232}{}{You're a raving lunatic...}
{233}{}{He is an enemy! Stop him in the name of the Fire!}
{234}{}{Relax, now we're playing my game.}
{235}{}{They won't be able to help you.}
{236}{}{Brothers, in the name of the Fire, throw this trash out into the street.}
{237}{}{Guards! Kill this spy! Immediately!}
{238}{}{They won't stop me...}
{239}{}{I want you dead. You're a filthy slaver and a tyrant!}

{240}{}{You're not exactly rolling out the welcome mat, are you?}
{241}{}{Continue in this manner and you will end up in a labor camp, like many before you.}
{242}{}{So this is how problems are solved in the church? I thought this was a place of peace and brotherhood.}
{243}{}{So it is. Until atomic vermin like you come in and start causing trouble. The world has become so wild that even a peaceful church must take up arms. You wasteland savages have much to learn.}
{244}{}{[Continue]}
{245}{}{I ask you one last time - what do you want?}
{246}{}{I just want to talk with you.}
{247}{}{After our brief conversation, I see no reason to continue. Leave.}
{248}{}{You'll pay for this treatment someday! I swear!}
{249}{}{Alright, I'll leave the cathedral peacefully.}

{250}{}{I'm sorry, but I don't have time for idle talk. Do you have any BUSINESS with me?}
{251}{}{Well, if I think about it, there is one thing. My village.}
{252}{}{Actually, no. Sorry for wasting your time with my idle curiosity.}
{1252}{}{Actually, no. Sorry for wasting your time with my idle curiosity.}
{253}{}{No, I'm just wandering with nothing better to do. If no one listens to me here, I'll find someplace else.}
{254}{}{Please, it's important to me to hear it directly.}

{255}{}{Excellent. The brothers will show you the way out.}
{256}{}{No, no, I can find my way without guides.}
{257}{}{You are so kind.}

{260}{}{This is becoming interesting. WHAT is your business with me?}
{261}{}{Obviously, it's your death. It would be foolish to leave a tyrant like you alive.}
{262}{}{This concerns the Villa. I am }
{263}{}{, a representative of this once-thriving community.}

{264}{}{I am an envoy of the Brotherhood of Steel. Can I expect a warm welcome and cooperation?}
{1264}{}{I am an envoy of the Brotherhood of Steel. Can I expect a warm welcome and cooperation?}
{265}{}{The Brotherhood of Steel is our loyal friend and reliable supporter. I am pleased to meet you. You will be provided with all the assistance you require.}
{266}{}{I didn't think such arrogant recruits joined the Brotherhood of Steel. But the Brotherhood is our loyal friend and reliable supporter. Stay in the cathedral. You will be provided with all the assistance you require.}
{267}{}{Thank you, Lord Aaron. You're very kind.}
{268}{}{Let's skip the formalities, Aaron. I've got business here.}


{270}{}{Ulysses warned me of your visit. According to him, you will bring great benefits to our cause. Well, do not disappoint my expectations, }
{271}{}{ from the Villa.}
{272}{}{I will do everything possible, Lord Aaron.}
{273}{}{I am the best at what I do. Rest assured.}
{1273}{}{I am the best at what I do. Rest assured.}
{274}{}{I was sent by Ulysses Grant.}

# After sending to Two-Sun
{280}{}{Holy Atom! I sent you to hard labor in Two-Sun. Why are you free?}
{281}{}{I managed to escape. And now you'll pay for everything!}
{282}{}{Brothers, stop him! Stop him!}
{283}{}{They won't stop me!}
{284}{}{I managed to negotiate with the Tinsmiths.}
{285}{}{This looks highly suspicious. But until I receive refutation, you can breathe the air of freedom. Appreciate this time granted to you by the Holy Fire.}
{286}{}{Suspicious? You're right. Because I'm here to take revenge.}
{287}{}{I'm trying.}
{288}{}{Open your eyes, you're not omnipotent.}
{289}{}{Hmm. You can breathe the air of freedom until I learn more. Appreciate this time granted to you by the Holy Fire. Now get out of here!}
{290}{}{Not so fast, tyrant. I won't leave while you breathe this air.}
{291}{}{That's a reasonable decision.}
{292}{}{Sending you to Two-Sun was a mistake.}
{293}{}{A mistake? Well, that depends on who you ask. The result suits me just fine.}
{294}{}{Brothers, get rid of this wretch.}
{295}{}{Aha.}
{296}{}{[Enter combat]}
{297}{}{N-no...}
{298}{}{Make sure this mistake doesn't prove fatal for you. And thank the Holy Fire that Grant granted you freedom.}
{299}{}{Well, well.}

# Re-dialogue
{300}{}{So what do you need?}
{301}{}{Once again, peasant, you dare to distract me from important matters.}
{1301}{}{And again, you, peasant woman, dare to distract me from important matters.}
{302}{}{So. What can you tell me?}
{303}{}{I'm glad to see you, Brotherhood of Steel envoy.}
{1303}{}{I'm glad to see you, Brotherhood of Steel envoy.}
{304}{}{Good to see you.}
{305}{}{Good to see you, acolyte.}
{1305}{}{Good to see you, acolyte.}
{306}{}{I thought I'd never see you again. What is it this time?}
{307}{}{May the Holy Fire bless you.}
{308}{}{Goodbye.}
{309}{}{I'll be going, with your permission.}

# Questions about the church and faith
{310}{}{Can I learn more about your faith?}
{311}{}{I would like to know more about your church.}
{312}{}{This is regularly preached in the auditorium on the first floor. I don't have time for this.}
{313}{}{I would like to hear from the most reliable source.}
{314}{}{This is regularly preached in the auditorium on the first floor. I don't have time to explain this to every passerby.}
{315}{}{Then I'll ask someone else.}
{316}{}{A passerby? Now everything is clear.}
{317}{}{}
{318}{}{Fear the Holy Fire, my child.}
{319}{}{Yes, uh, of course.}

{320}{}{If you're interested in our faith, come to the services in the auditorium on the first floor. I don't have time to answer everyone. Do you have any BUSINESS with me?}
{321}{}{Well, if you think about it, there is one thing. My village.}
{322}{}{Actually, no. Sorry for wasting your time with my idle curiosity.}
{1322}{}{Actually, no. Sorry for wasting your time with my idle curiosity.}
{323}{}{No, I'm just wandering around with nothing to do. If no one listens to me here, I'll go somewhere else.}
{324}{}{Please, it's important for me to hear from firsthand.}

{330}{}{This is getting interesting. WHAT business do you have with me?}
{331}{}{It concerns the Villa.}
{332}{}{Obviously, it's your death. It would be reckless to leave a tyrant like you alive.}
{333}{}{Excellent. The brothers will show you the way out.}
{334}{}{No-no, I'll find my way without escorts.}
{335}{}{You are so kind.}
{336}{}{This is an assassin! In the name of the Fire, stop him!}
{337}{}{Relax, I'm in charge here now.}
{338}{}{They won't help you.}
{339}{}{Blessings on your way out.}

{340}{}{Of course. Please.}
{341}{}{Maybe we can talk about the Villa?}
{342}{}{So what's the essence of your faith?}
{343}{}{You are the leader of this church, right?}
{344}{}{I've heard enough today. Thanks for the conversation.}
{345}{}{I repeat - I don't have time for this.}
{346}{}{Okay, I'll talk to others.}
{347}{}{You're just trying to get rid of me.}

{350}{}{You already know everything you need to.}
{351}{}{I respect your interest in our teachings. But not everyone is capable of understanding them.}
{352}{}{[Next]}
{353}{}{Our church calls for the acceptance of the Holy Fire as an act of healing, as a chance to start life anew. A... 'Rebirth'. For without a rebirth, people still engage in meaningless struggles with each other.}
{354}{}{What exactly is this Holy Fire?}
{355}{}{Now I understand, you can stop.}
{356}{}{The fire that scorched the world a hundred years ago. We call it holy because it punished fallen humanity and cleansed the earth of corruption, thus giving descendants a chance to live a new life.}
{357}{}{Wasn't that some kind of powerful weapon?}
{358}{}{Technically, yes. But that's not important. For the Lord punished people with their own hands. The average person sees a nuclear bomb, we see God's plan.}
{359}{}{You said "rebirth". Does the church aim to change the world?}
{360}{}{By uniting and consolidating lands for the common goal of survival. We need to unite lands, reclaim and rethink ancient technologies, revive nuclear energy, and teach people literacy.}
{361}{}{So you force others into your faith?}
{362}{}{No, no. Such followers would be harmful to the church. Membership must be voluntary. Additionally, we are very selective about accepting new members; each person requires a sponsor.}
{363}{}{What does "unite lands" mean?}
{364}{}{One banner, one country, one people... one faith. People must renounce all internecine conflicts and fully commit to the Rebirth.}
{365}{}{And how far has the church spread?}
{366}{}{We have chapels in the Phoenix area and several neighboring towns. By modern standards, this is a vast territory. But we still have room to grow.}
{367}{}{Now I understand how the church is connected with slavers.}
{368}{}{You also engage in struggle. Aren't you considered a tyrant who usurped power?}

{370}{}{The common populace has fallen to the level of animals and is incapable of participating in the great cause of Rebirth voluntarily. Slavery is merely a necessary and temporary means for our mission. Besides, we never enslaved anyone ourselves, only paid mercenaries for their work, turning a blind eye to their brute measures.}
{371}{}{Your mission has merit. Can I join your church?}
{372}{}{Enough! This kind of religion has no place in our world. I will destroy you all.}
{373}{}{Thanks for the conversation, now I understand much more.}
{374}{}{By the way, are you the ones behind the capture and enslavement of the Villa peasants?}
{375}{}{By the way, about the capture and enslavement of the Villa peasants...}

{380}{}{Are you the one who runs this whole process?}
{381}{}{Of course.}
{382}{}{Then you can better explain to me the essence of your church.}
{383}{}{Nice to meet you. I was curious about nothing else.}
{384}{}{People consider you a tyrant. Do you know that?}
{385}{}{Malicious tongues. Apparently, such a reputation stuck with the church after the revolution. Yes, we came to power by force. It was a necessary measure. But our hearts have always been at peace.}
{386}{}{I get the impression that your cult owns this city...}
{387}{}{The church indeed became something greater for Phoenix. Thanks to us, science, education, and medicine returned to the city. We introduced the cap currency and are establishing trade links. Thanks to us, crime in the city has decreased. But the majority of citizens live beyond our attention.}
{388}{}{Wow, that's quite a turn. I want to know more about your church.}
{389}{}{No matter how you cloak it in pretty words, you're an ordinary tyrant. And I will kill you so that others won't follow your path.}
{390}{}{I'm afraid I must go. My respects, Lord Aaron.}
{391}{}{You look more like a tyrant than an priest.}
{392}{}{The Church had to take on the burden of ruling this city. This is necessary until society is ready for a full-fledged city hall and police.}

# Villa
{400}{}{I want to talk to you about the Villa.}
{401}{}{}
{402}{}{Villa... Yes, I remember our conversation about that village.}
{403}{}{I think we've already discussed everything. Goodbye, Lord Aaron.}
{404}{}{Hmm... Villa... I've never heard of it. Well, what of it? Speak.}
{405}{}{Actually, I'm looking for my relatives. They've been enslaved.}
{406}{}{Oh, poor people. I infinitely sympathize with you and will pray for the salvation of their souls. But why did your search lead you to us?}
{407}{}{Your church is clearly involved in this! Return my relatives.}
{408}{}{That wasn't very polite of you. We are merely a peaceful church; we do not enslave anyone.}
{409}{}{You're lying.}
{410}{}{It's sad to see such wild ignorance. I'm forced to... (one of the advisers interrupts the Lord and whispers something in his ear) I see. So you want to reunite with your relatives? We can arrange that.}
{411}{}{Really? How?}
{412}{}{Lay down your weapons and raise your hands. Don't get any ideas about resisting. You'll be sent to hard labor with the rest of your kin.}
{413}{}{Well, if it helps find my relatives, I voluntarily surrender to slavery.}
{414}{}{You can't scare me. I'll leave here just as I entered.}
{1414}{}{You can't scare me. I'll leave here just as I entered.}
{415}{}{It's a pity it has come to this. Seize him!}
{1415}{}{It's a pity it has come to this. Seize her!}
{416}{}{Your words sound more insignificant than the atom's moan in a fiery cloud. Send him to our brothers in Two-Sun, let him serve the Holy Fire.}
{1416}{}{Your words sound more insignificant than the atom's moan in a fiery cloud. Send her to our brothers in Two-Sun, let her serve the Holy Fire.}
{417}{}{(one of the advisers interrupts the Lord and whispers something in his ear) Hmm. It seems I have to let you go. But remember, in the future, any who go against the church of the Holy Fire will be punished.}
{418}{}{Okay, well, we'll see about that.}
{419}{}{Just tell me what to do.}
{420}{}{I thought you knew everything around here.}
{421}{}{Alas, that's not the case.}
{422}{}{Well, excuse me. I'll go look elsewhere...}
{423}{}{Wait, easy now... I'm not gonna resist.}
{424}{}{As a member of the Brotherhood of Steel, I expect cooperation in finding the missing peasants.}
{425}{}{Strange that the Brotherhood of Steel is interested in these peasants. Of course, we will help you.}
{426}{}{So what do you know about this case?}
{427}{}{You're lying. I'm not leaving until I get the whole truth.}
{428}{}{Everyone, back off! Get the fuck back! I'll defend myself!}
{429}{}{First one who touches me, dies. Got it?}

{430}{}{Enough of this charade. I KNOW this church funded the slave convoy.}
{431}{}{Your insolence knows no bounds.}
{432}{}{I won't leave until I find out what's going on.}
{433}{}{Go in peace, envoy of the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{434}{}{My respects.}
{435}{}{Faking respect? I'll remember that.}

{436}{}{Who dared lay a hand on your family? I will not tolerate such treatment of my bishop!}
{437}{}{That's what I want to know. Will you help me?}
{438}{}{(signals to the scribe, who searches for something on the computer and then reports the result in a whisper) I'm very sorry, but your relatives have already gone to work in the Forbidden Zone in the south.}
{450}{}{Hmm. Remind me what this village is called? (one of the advisers approaches the Lord and whispers something in his ear) Um... Yes, we know where these peasants are. They received a second chance and are now working for the Rebirth in the south.}

{452}{}{I remember our conversation. The peasants received a second chance and are contributing to the Rebirth in the south.}
{453}{}{South? But where exactly?}
{454}{}{Some of them were left in Flagstaff to work in the mine. The rest were sent to Two-Sun to serve for the benefit of Progress. Local Tinsmiths do not have enough workers to work in the Forbidden Zone. Such a fate is honorable, because with their sacrifice these slaves will help the whole world.}
{459}{}{Why these unnecessary questions? During your enslavement, you were given the opportunity to understand the Tinsmiths better. This tribe reveres ancient technology, although they see it in a very narrow light.}
{460}{}{Who are these Tinsmiths?}
{461}{}{A reclusive tribe of ancient technology worshippers. Like us, they advocate for the rebirth of the Old World, but they see it exclusively through a technological lens. For now, we share common goals, but someday, most likely, misunderstandings will turn into conflict.}
{462}{}{I guess their technology matters a lot to you?}
{463}{}{Without the Tinsmiths' manufacturing base, we couldn't even run electricity in this cathedral. We need their machines and skills.}
{464}{}{You both need to be destroyed. Starting with this false, godless cathedral.}
{465}{}{That explains everything. I have no more questions.}
{466}{}{Is the prison in Flagstaff your doing as well?}
{467}{}{The Flagstaff colony was founded on our caps. But over time, it has become more independent.}
{468}{}{Why do you need this colony?}
{469}{}{Obviously for the production of uranium in the mine there.}
{470}{}{But why does the church need uranium?}
{471}{}{Uranium is necessary for generating nuclear energy. Without it, it's impossible to use old technologies. And without them, there can be no talk of civilization's 'Rebirth'.}
{472}{}{Doesn't Faber cause you problems?}
{473}{}{Is Faber starting to overstep himself?}
{474}{}{In a way. Sometimes you eat the mole rat, and sometimes it eats you. Faber shares many of our views but sees them his own way. This occasionally creates minor conflicts.}
{475}{}{Great. Then I'll follow his example and take over this defenseless cathedral.}
{476}{}{I think I'll head to Flagstaff and find out everything firsthand. Goodbye.}
{477}{}{In a way. By allowing people into power, you always run the risk of making an enemy out of a friend. However, it has become known that Faber is no longer in the picture. It's unclear if he was accidentally killed or if it's a clever plot by the local revolution. We're still dealing with this issue.}
{478}{}{What did you say about the Tinsmiths again?}

{480}{}{I've had enough of your excuses and 'justifications'. I'm leaving.}
{481}{}{It seems you have grand plans. Now I can leave here with a calm heart.}
{482}{}{But why do you use slavery?}
{483}{}{So that's why you use slavery?}
{484}{}{Society is not ready to be... free. These people will never rise from their knees on their own. They need tyrants and teachers.}
{485}{}{So, you're responsible for the enslavement of Villa?}
{486}{}{Don't be quick to accuse. We only sponsor our colonies and various projects with caps. And if slave labor is needed to support them, then caps will go to buy slaves.}
{487}{}{This is a disgrace to the 'church'. You must be taken out.}
{488}{}{An interesting point of view. Others might see things differently.}
{489}{}{Building a society on the backs of slaves is a cruel and broken path.}
{490}{}{Oh, you're mistaken. History is full of successful examples. Besides, society is not ready to be... free. It needs tyrants and teachers.}
{491}{}{How is this related to the Tinsmiths in Two-Sun?}
{492}{}{Now I understand your connection to the slavers of Flagstaff.}

#Become a Follower
{500}{}{I am considering joining your church.}
{501}{}{It is not as simple as you think. To be accepted into service, a sponsor or a significant contribution to our mission is required. What do you have to say to that?}
{502}{}{I don't have a sponsor.}
{503}{}{Our church is constantly under attack. Prove that we can trust you, and then we will discuss your initiation.}
{504}{}{I will try to find a sponsor.}
{505}{}{How can I prove my loyalty?}
{506}{}{. . . [a test task]}
{507}{}{I will return when the matter is resolved.}
{508}{}{I will do what it takes to prove my worth to the Holy Fire.}
{509}{}{An unknown wanderer such as yourself hardly qualifies.}
{510}{}{Alright, I'll go find a sponsor.}
{511}{}{But I truly want to join your church.}
{512}{}{To be accepted into service, a sponsor is required... But I doubt the purity of your intentions, villager from the Villa.}
{1512}{}{To be accepted into service, a sponsor is required... But I doubt the purity of your intentions, peasant woman from the Villa.}
{513}{}{Ulysses Grant advised me to talk to you.}
{514}{}{Is membership in the Brotherhood of Steel a sufficient basis?}
{515}{}{Here is a letter of recommendation from the preacher in Flagstaff.}
{516}{}{(listens to the advisor's whisper) This letter has no value. Get out.}
{517}{}{Um, but...}
{518}{}{I had a letter of recommendation from Flagstaff. But it seems to have disappeared.}
{519}{}{I'm having second thoughts about joining your church. Goodbye.}
{520}{}{Arthur Carrington can recommend me.}
{521}{}{Keeper Francis will be my sponsor.}
{522}{}{Give me a chance.}
{523}{}{Here is a letter of recommendation from George Crook.}

{530}{}{Well, in that case, I am glad to welcome you to the abode of wisdom and progress. Our church seeks to heal the world from the wounds of the Great War. And you will help us in this difficult mission.}
{531}{}{Excellent. What can I do for the church?}
{532}{}{I hope it is clear that the church has many enemies. Recently, hostility has increased. Several acolytes were killed right in the city streets, in broad daylight. I ask you to investigate these crimes.}
{533}{}{The attackers chose the wrong target. But where should I start?}
{534}{}{Find Gabriel; he preaches at the city gates and is well-informed about the city's affairs. But be... patient. His fanaticism sometimes scares even our church members.}
{535}{}{I'll return when the matter is resolved.}
{536}{}{I'll do my best.}

#First quest
{550}{}{About those crimes against the church.}
{551}{}{Have you managed to find anything out?}
{552}{}{Unfortunately, no. This case runs deep.}
{553}{}{That's unfortunate. But I don't lose hope. Talk to Gabriel at the city gates; he will tell you the details of the attacks.}
{554}{}{Alright, I'll go speak with him.}
{555}{}{It seems you have serious enemies. They are well-organized and well-equipped. More importantly, they're watching you.}
{556}{}{Are you saying that these attacks were planned? Coordinated? That someone was watching the acolytes and preparing for the attack in advance?}
{557}{}{Exactly.}
{558}{}{(purses his lips in thought and approaches the altar) ...Likely. Yet, no one outside the cathedral knows our routines. The acolyte schedule is pre-planned a week in advance. If the attackers, as you say, were preparing for the attack, how did they find out about these schedules?}
{559}{}{Who has access to the schedules?}
{560}{}{Each head priest makes the schedule for their acolytes and sends it to the library. Only a few people have access to the complete list.}
{561}{}{It seems I need to visit this treasure trove of old books. Allow me to take my leave.}
{562}{}{Alright, I'll go there and check it out.}
{563}{}{I'm not entirely sure, but it seems pretty likely...}

{570}{}{The acolytes routines were being leaked. By Matthias. He monitored the acolytes' schedule and then transmitted the data to the church's enemies via the radio.}
{571}{}{(Lord Aaron's lips turn blood-red with anger) Matthias... I should have guessed earlier. How could one of my closest advisors betray me? Guards! Find Matthias and arrest him immediately.}
{572}{}{Be gentle with this well-intentioned man.}
{573}{}{Right. No mercy for that traitor.}
{574}{}{(wanders the hall in thought) Deception everywhere... I cannot trust even my closest subordinates. No one could have thought that Matthias hated the state of affairs in the church so much.}
{575}{}{He was against your policies, wasn't he?}
{576}{}{Matthias believed the cathedral should remain isolated, keeping our relics locked away from the world. He didn't think anyone outside was worthy of them. But I disagreed. It's time to bring all our knowledge out of the dust and into the light, for the sake of the Holy Fire.}
{577}{}{It seems not everyone shares your vision.}
{578}{}{(nods graciously) You have worked well, brother. And more importantly, you have proven your loyalty. I need your further assistance to cleanse the lands of Phoenix from filth.}
{1578}{}{(nods graciously) You have worked well, sister. And more importantly, you have proven your loyalty. I need your further assistance to cleanse the lands of Phoenix from filth.}
{579}{}{Anything for the Holy Fire, your holiness.}
{580}{}{What do you need of me this time?}
{581}{}{Apparently, a group of fire-hating rebels is operating somewhere in the city. Well-organized and armed. We will extract all information about them from Matthias, but that is not enough. You need to find their hideout and infiltrate their ranks. Can you handle it?}
{582}{}{Possibly. But why me?}
{583}{}{For our church, you are still new. The rebels are unlikely to recognize you as one of us.}
{584}{}{If I find their hideout, what should I do?}
{585}{}{Inform me. We will decide what to do next.}
{586}{}{I suppose, but it's no easy task.}
{587}{}{Matthias used the radio to communicate with the rebels. Also, many city residents could be connected to this group. Try all possible means.}
{588}{}{I will do my best. I'll take my leave.}
{589}{}{But why me?}
{590}{}{You haven't really deemed that many people to be 'worthy' either, have you?}

#Quest enhancement by cambragol
{591}{}{Yes, the acolytes routines may have been leaked. Matthias seems to have been checking their schedules recently...}
{592}{}{Yes, the acolytes routines may have been leaked. Matthias seems to have been using the radio to communicate with someone outside the cathedral...}
{593}{}{Matthias? Are you insane? He is one of my most trusted advisors. Look elsewhere, fool.}
{594}{}{Uh, yes, of course my Lord.}

#Second quest
{600}{}{I've made progress with the rebel group.}
{601}{}{Really? Tell me more.}
{602}{}{Honestly, so far there's just a lot dubious rumors. I'll keep checking it out, but there may not be much too them.}
{603}{}{The rebels were hiding in the sewers. Their leader is dead now though, and the group is broken and scattered...}
{604}{}{...Very good. I will send people to clean up the lair of these criminals, and you should be commended. It seems that the Holy Fire has sent us enlightenment in your body.}
{605}{}{I can continue to serve the church if it is useful.}
{606}{}{I do not doubt it, my child. And moreover, now we need friends more than ever.}
{607}{}{How can I help, Lord Aaron?}
{608}{}{They call themselves the 'Liberation Party', and I know where their headquarters is located.}
{609}{}{You may have encountered our preachers outside of Phoenix. The church is growing and opening its chapels where people are ready to listen to us. But the village of San Brahmin has become a stumbling block for our faith.}
{610}{}{[Next]}
{611}{}{The local residents, initially friendly, have for some reason become hostile to the church. Our attempts to reason with them have only worsened the situation. We do not know exactly what is happening. Currently, George Crook's detachment is stationed near the village. Find him and offer your help. We need to restore our trade agreements with this village.}
{612}{}{[Next]}
{613}{}{Here are 350 caps for the road and to buy everything you need. Go. May the Holy Fire bless you.}
{614}{}{I will find out what is happening in San Brahmin. San Brahmin will believe in the power of the Holy Fire once again.}
{615}{}{I will do my best.}
{616}{}{You have already helped many, my friend. George Crook told me about your feat. I was going to send you to help him, but you managed to get ahead of me. Now I want to hear everything from you: how is our mission progressing in San Brahmin?}
{1616}{}{You have already helped many, maiden of Atom. George Crook told me about your feat. I was going to send you to help him, but you managed to get ahead of me. Now I want to hear everything from you: how is our mission progressing in San Brahmin?}
{617}{}{Yes, there is news to discuss.}

#Third quest
{630}{}{I need to talk to you about the situation in San Brahmin.}
{631}{}{Of course. What news, my child?}
{632}{}{I'll visit the village soon and find out the details. Goodbye.}
{633}{}{[CHEAT: the job is done with the best result for the Overlord]}
{634}{}{[Blah blah glory to the Fire - blah blah talk to the Advisor in the vault, here is the key and access - blah blah eliminate George Crook]}
{635}{}{[CHEAT: completing quests - getting the title + being sent to the vault + reward + cathedral radio frequency]}
{636}{}{I bring news of victory, Lord Aaron. I convinced the tribe's leader to sign the alliance, and Crook's detachment settled near the village.}
{1636}{}{I bring news of victory, Lord Aaron. I convinced the tribe's leader to sign the alliance, and Crook's detachment settled near the village.}
{637}{}{Glory to the Holy Fire! And blessings to it for sending you to us in these difficult times. You are deserving of reward.}
{638}{}{For me, this was a sacred duty.}
{639}{}{I don't know if the Holy Fire helped, but it's done.}
{640}{}{Hmm, in his report, George Crook also speaks highly of your personal qualities and loyalty to the Phoenix Empire. Considering this, and your numerous services to the church, I cannot fail to reward and honor you.}
{641}{}{It has been my honor to serve, Your Holiness.}
{642}{}{How?}
{643}{}{For your services to the Phoenix Empire, and the Church of the Holy Fire, I solemnly appoint you as my bishop. Take this blessed robe as a token of gratitude and symbol of your station. Let it protect you from enemy bullets and lies.}
{644}{}{Thank you.}
{645}{}{It is also time to initiate you into our church's inner cabal. Here is the key to the church's lower levels. There you will find an ancient sanctuary. Tell the guards to take you to Ulysses Grant. I'll inform him of your coming visit.}
{646}{}{[More]}
{647}{}{Go, my bishop. May the Fire bless you.}
{648}{}{Thank you for the honor, Lord Aaron.}

{650}{}{My lord, the news is disturbing - George Crook died during his mission.}
{651}{}{(takes a deep breath and crosses his fingers on his chest) May the Holy Fire soothe his soul. He was the best warrior I ever knew. And if even he failed to resist the savages, who can fulfill his mission?}
{652}{}{I don't think I could handle it.}
{653}{}{Perhaps I can do it.}
{654}{}{You must! Return to San Brahmin and conquer the tribe in the name of the Holy Fire! This is your sacred duty. And if you can't, sow discord within the tribe. Kill their high chief so that the savages fight for his throne. Make the Rangers flee the pueblo. Go. Go!}
{655}{}{Yes, my lord...}
{656}{}{The news is bad. The tribe formed an alliance with the Rangers, who then drove the missionaries out of the pueblo and surrounding lands.}
{657}{}{(takes a deep breath and crosses his fingers on his chest) We're too late. How much effort was spent on conquering this tribe, all in vain!}
{658}{}{Is everything lost? Maybe I can salvage something?}
{659}{}{Perhaps I can change the chief's mind, or disrupt the alliance?}
{660}{}{Their leader is dead. And the tribe is divided. However, at least it will be difficult for the Rangers to take advantage of the situation.}
{661}{}{A poor silver lining for this failure. It's hard to accept defeat. How many setbacks must we endure? But, what is, is. We will be patient. The savages fell to their level after many generations. It will probably take at least as long to guide them back to a civilized state.}
{662}{}{[Listen]}
{663}{}{And your service is over. As much as I would like to cast you out of the cathedral after such failure, my advisors have come to a different conclusion. I will allow you to meet with my chief advisor, Ulysses Grant. Take this key and go down to the lower levels. Security will take you to Ulysses. He's looking forward to seeing you.}
{664}{}{Thank you, my lord.}
