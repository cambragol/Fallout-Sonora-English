{100}{}{You see Angelo.}
{101}{}{You see the little boss of a not-so-small business. He examines you carefully.}
{102}{}{No talk until I see you without your armor.}
{103}{}{DIE!}
{104}{}{SEE YOU IN HELL!}
{105}{}{PREPARE TO DIE!}
{106}{}{AR-RGH!}
{107}{}{DEATH TO HUMANS!}

#Before participating in battles
{200}{}{(In front of you stands a tough-looking dwarf with a no-nonsense attitude) What do you want? Betting on a fight or looking to join in?}
{201}{}{Neither. Just curious how someone... so little, like you... runs the ring?}
{202}{}{(snarls from the bristling bodyguard) Stop, Rico! Calm down brother, it's fine. These wasteland savages don't know city life. Relax...}
{203}{}{[More]}
{204}{}{And a free tip - watch your filthy tongue. (Pours himself tequila into a dirty glass, like a mobster) The city values BRAINS, not MUSCLES. I'm the brains here. I set up this business and get the biggest cut. Show some respect, or Rico will turn you into mince. Got it?}
{205}{}{Yes... sir.}
{206}{}{Great. So, what do you want?}
{207}{}{I want to bet on a fight.}
{208}{}{I want to fight.}
{209}{}{Looks like I'm wasting my time. Goodbye, Mr. Brain.}

{210}{}{You pet Rico doesn't bother me.}
{211}{}{Rico, throw this punk outside...}
{212}{}{Touch me, and you're dead.}
{213}{}{Okay, okay, don't push...}
{214}{}{Again? You're starting to get on my nerves.}
{215}{}{You can't just throw me out! I demand compensation.}
{216}{}{Sorry. I see now that I need to show a little more respect.}
{217}{}{Rico, throw this trash out on the street. If he tries to come in again, break his neck.}
{1217}{}{Rico, throw this bitch out on the street. If she tries to come in again, break her neck.}
{218}{}{What a brainless fuck. Rico!}
{219}{}{Don't you dare...}

{220}{}{I want to bet.}
{221}{}{Now's not a good time. We haven't compiled a fight list yet, not enough new blood.}
{222}{}{What about me? Can I have a shot?}
{223}{}{Too bad. I'll come back when the fights starts.}
{224}{}{Who runs this club?}
{225}{}{I'm the manager. Name's Angelo Rossitto. Anything else?}
{226}{}{You? No way.}
{227}{}{That's all. Goodbye.}
{228}{}{In that case, I have a proposal - I want to try my hands in the fights.}
{229}{}{Can I join the fights?}
{230}{}{(Looks you up and down, then signals to the bodyguard) Rico, check this guy out.}
{1230}{}{A woman in the ring? Interesting... Could be a good publicity stunt. Rico, inspect the goods.}
{231}{}{Hey, hey, what are you up to?}
{232}{}{Be gentle, big guy.}
{233}{}{(Rico examines your muscles and reflexes, then shakes his head at the boss)}
{234}{}{Well, what does this mean?}
{235}{}{It means you're not good enough. Bulk up a bit, then we'll talk.}
{236}{}{I doubt I'll be back after this. Goodbye.}
{237}{}{Alright. Challenge accepted.}
{238}{}{(Rico examines your muscles and evaluates your reflexes, then nods to the boss)}
{239}{}{Well, what does this mean?}
{240}{}{You have potential. We could find you a match, but honestly, I'm not sure about your skills. Train first. If you still want to fight, come back and we'll arrange it.}
{241}{}{Great, I'll do that.}
{242}{}{You have potential. But this is risky. Think about it. If you really want to fight, come back, and we'll set up a good match for you.}
{243}{}{Give me time to think about it.}

{250}{}{So, what do you want?}
{251}{}{Just wanted to say hello. I'm leaving. Bye.}
{252}{}{Can I bet on the fight?}
{253}{}{I want to fight in the ring. Seriously.}
{254}{}{Call the manager.}

{260}{}{How are you, champ? The audience misses you. But it's time to make way for the young blood.}
{261}{}{Everything's fine. Bye, Angelo.}
{262}{}{I'll leave so I don't have to listen to these excuses.}
{263}{}{How's life, }
{264}{}{? The crowd misses you. But it's time to give way to the young blood. You know how it is.}

{270}{}{What do you want to know?}
{271}{}{Bye.}
{272}{}{How did you become a ring manager?}
{273}{}{Ask whatever you want, }
{274}{}{.}
{275}{}{That's all I wanted to know.}

{280}{}{Where can I practice?}
{281}{}{The training room is near the stairs. But finding a coach is a problem. Iron Mike used to train fighters, but now he's just a retired drunk.}
{282}{}{Where can I find him?}
{283}{}{He lives in the building right across from the arena. But he might not open the door, so be persistent.}
{284}{}{How did you become a ring manager?}
{285}{}{If an experienced fighter became a trainer, then how did you become a manager?}
{286}{}{You need to use your brain. I am the brains here. Rico is the muscle. Simple, right?}
{287}{}{I see. If you're so smart, then tell me where I can practice around here.}
{288}{}{There's more to success than just brains. It's tough to make it in the city.}
{289}{}{Count on it...}
{290}{}{What happened to Mike?}
{291}{}{Not sure if I should tell you, but Mike's students once killed his girlfriend during a mugging. That's when he lost faith in people.}


# Participation in battles
{300}{}{(looks you over and nods approvingly) Not bad. We've got a match lined up for you. You planning to fight?}
{301}{}{Hold up. I need to ask you something first.}
{302}{}{Sure. Who's my opponent?}
{303}{}{I'm not in shape yet. Give me a bit more time.}
{304}{}{A wanderer from the wasteland. As dusty and unknown as you.}
{305}{}{How much will I earn if I take him down in the ring?}
{306}{}{All about the caps, huh? Don't expect to earn a lot at the start. Show your skills first. For the first fight, you get 100 caps. That's as good as you'll get anywhere in Phoenix for a regular fight.}
{307}{}{One last question - do I have to kill him?}
{308}{}{Depends on your skill and will. A kill in the ring excites the crowd and boosts your fame. So, what do you say?}
{309}{}{That's all well and good, but I have other questions right now.}
{310}{}{Well, I'm ready to fight. When does it start?}
{311}{}{Give me time to get ready.}
{312}{}{Come at 20:00. One more thing - you need a catchy nickname if you plan to fight regularly. Something powerful, memorable. Got any ideas?}
{313}{}{[More]}
{314}{}{[Previous]}
{315}{}{? Not bad. Don't forget about the time. Be here at 20:00. If you're late, I'll have to put in other fighters. So don't let me down, }
{316}{}{Okay. I'll be there on time.}
{317}{}{You're too early. Come back at 20:00.}
{318}{}{Okay.}
{319}{}{Well, well, look who finally showed up. I was starting to think you didn't have the guts to step into the ring. Guess you've got a little courage after all.}
{320}{}{More than you think. Lead me to the ring.}
{321}{}{Wait, wait, I need to hit the toilet. Be right back.}
{322}{}{I know. Just wanted to chat before we start.}
{323}{}{You're just in time. The crowd's warmed up, it's showtime.}
{324}{}{I'm ready to kick ass. Take me to the ring!}
{1324}{}{I'm ready to kick ass. Take me to the ring!}
{325}{}{Give me a little more time to get prepped.}
{326}{}{Big Mario's waiting for you. And it's not just him - glory's on the line if you can take him down. So, }
{327}{}{? You ready for the final showdown?}
{328}{}{Big Mario Albright's going down today. Let's go, Angelo. Walk me in like the champ I'm about to be.}
{329}{}{Mario's gonna have to wait. I'll be back soon.}

# First fight
{330}{}{Pretty good for a newbie. Even though you got beat up a bit. Still, the potential is there. Don't stop now.}
{331}{}{Pretty good for a newbie. You've got potential worth developing.}
{332}{}{Really? That's encouraging.}
{333}{}{I'm not here to show off. I'm here for the caps.}
{334}{}{Here's your fee, 100 caps. Fair win. If you want another fight, come back and we'll arrange it.}
{335}{}{I'm ready for another fight anytime. Set up a match for me.}
{336}{}{Angelo, I saw my own death in that ring today. I'm not going through that again. Goodbye.}
{337}{}{There won't be a next time.}
{338}{}{.}

# Second fight
{340}{}{You're making progress, }
{341}{}{. Very good. I hope you're not stopping here.}
{342}{}{Very good. The crowd is starting to like you, and more importantly, ME.}
{343}{}{What about my fee?}
{344}{}{Deal's always fair with me. Here's your 200 caps. Don't spend it all at once. And get ready for your next fight.}
{345}{}{Who's my next opponent?}
{346}{}{Let me think... You need a bigger challenge... How about Canelo? He's won ten in a row. A serious opponent. The crowd loves a good fight.}
{347}{}{Great, I'll take on Canelo. He won't stand a chance.}
{348}{}{I'll think about it. Bye, Angelo.}

# Third fight
{350}{}{Great fight, }
{351}{}{. Haven't seen such exciting matches in a long time. You're almost ready for the championship title. ALMOST.}
{352}{}{Can you line me up another fight?}
{353}{}{Alright, if you've got the guts. Here's your fee, 400 caps.}
{354}{}{So, my next fight's against a real pro?}
{355}{}{Not just any pro. The undefeated Big Mario Albright! He's been itching to take you on. Prepare yourself - nobody's ever taken him down.}
{356}{}{I can feel the beast waking up inside me. No way I'm backing down from this.}
{357}{}{I don't think I've got another fight like that in me. Goodbye, Angelo.}
{358}{}{Almost? Show me whose face I gotta smash to become the best.}
{1358}{}{Almost? Show me whose face I gotta smash to become the best.}

# - last Stand
{360}{}{That was one hell of a fight, }
{361}{}{! The crowd went wild; we haven't seen excitement like that in ages. We pulled in massive bets because everyone thought Big Mario was unbeatable. But you proved them wrong! Well done. Here's your 800 caps. But... now we've got a bit of a problem.}
{362}{}{What's the issue?}
{363}{}{Well, you're basically a champion now. Unbeatable, you know? We don't have anyone left to pit against you. And if people keep betting on you and winning, we won't see any profits. Most of our earnings come from lost bets, you get me?}
{364}{}{So, you're saying I'm done fighting?}
{365}{}{What the hell! You're kicking me out of the ring?}
{366}{}{Exactly. Sorry, amigo, but every fighter's got their golden moment. It's been good doing business with you, but now it's time to part ways.}
{1366}{}{Exactly. Sorry, amiga, but every fighter's got their golden moment. It's been good doing business with you, but now it's time to part ways.}
{367}{}{Damn, Angelo, it's always about the caps with you, isn't it? Guess there's nothing left for me here.}
{368}{}{Fuck you!}

{370}{}{Tell me about my opponent.}
{371}{}{Tell me about my new opponent.}
{372}{}{Tell me about my next opponent.}
{373}{}{Tell me about my opponent.}
{374}{}{A drifter from the wasteland. Just a regular in the ring, nothing special.}
{375}{}{A former desert raider, goes by the name Savage. After his gang got wiped out, he came to Phoenix to earn caps by fighting. It's all he knows. He loves a brawl, but he's not in great shape anymore. No surprise, he's been living like a highway rat.}
{376}{}{Canelo's one of the top fighters in the ring. You two are a solid match. He's been training hard, so watch out-he's faster and stronger than anyone you've faced so far.}
{377}{}{This time, you're up against a real monster of a man. They call him Big Mario. He's racked up so many wins, I've lost track. Nobody wants to fight him anymore. Except you. It's gonna be brutal, but think about all the caps we'll rake in.}
{1377}{}{This time, you're up against a real monster of a man. They call him Big Mario. He's racked up so many wins, I've lost track. Nobody wants to fight him anymore. Except you. It's gonna be brutal, but think about all the caps we'll rake in.}
{378}{}{Got it. Time to get ready for the fight.}

{380}{}{How's life, }
{381}{}{? The audience misses you. And guess what? I've got a contender for you. It's like you two were made for each other. Interested?}
{382}{}{No. I'm done fighting.}
{1382}{}{No. I'm done fighting.}
{383}{}{Sorry to hear that. Well, if you change your mind, let me know.}
{384}{}{Alright.}
{385}{}{Sure, why not? Tell me about this guy.}
{386}{}{Bring him on!}
{387}{}{What enthusiasm! You won't regret it.}
{388}{}{So, tell me about this guy.}
{389}{}{Some big, green-skinned brute rolled into town. A god-damn mutant, motherfucker. Biceps like freakin' bridge supports. No one's been able to take him down. Nobody. But you... you might just stand a chance.}
{390}{}{Then get it all set up. I'll be there at 20:00 as usual.}
{391}{}{Oh no, I've seen some of those before. I'll pass.}
{392}{}{The Big Green Son of a Bitch is waiting for you in the ring, }
{393}{}{.}
{394}{}{He's waiting for his death. Here it comes.}
{395}{}{Is that him!? I need, uh, a drink of water. Give me a couple of minutes.}
{396}{}{There's never been any spectacle like this in Phoenix before! The fight was unforgettable. Legendary. Tales will be told about this fight, for years and years. Well, how do you feel? Looks like you got pretty beat up. Here's' 1500 caps. You'll need them to get back to normal.}
{397}{}{You're being especially eloquent today, Angelo. I appreciate it. And thanks for the caps.}
{398}{}{I almost got killed, and here you are, happy as a child. I'm done here, for good.}
