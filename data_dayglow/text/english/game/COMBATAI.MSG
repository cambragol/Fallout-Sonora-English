{3064}{}{I can't feel my toes.}
{3065}{}{I can't feel my legs.}
{3066}{}{It feels like my whole leg is torn off.}
{3067}{}{I think my kneecap is shattered.}
{3068}{}{Aargh, the pain!}
{3069}{}{Where's my foot?}
#
#  HIT IN LEFT LEG
#
{3070}{}{Is that a bone?}
{3071}{}{Why does it hurt so much?}
{3072}{}{Judging by the pain, my toe's gone...}
{3073}{}{Please, not the legs!}
{3074}{}{I won't survive without a leg!}
{3075}{}{Now they'll call me Limpy.}
{3076}{}{Losing a leg is the last thing I wanted.}

{3123}{}{Okay, now I'm starting to get mad.}
{3124}{}{Oh, there's going to be blood. I'll bring the bandages.}
{3125}{}{Promise not to get mad.}
{3126}{}{I'm trying, don't interrupt.}
{3127}{}{I honestly didn't want to do this...}
{3128}{}{Uh, I don't want to hurt anyone.}
{3129}{}{Don't make me hurt you.}
{3130}{}{Just leave, and I won't get hurt.}
{3131}{}{Oh god, forgive me for my sins.}
{3132}{}{I guess I have to defend myself.}
{3133}{}{I always thought I wouldn't go this far!}
{3134}{}{This will be the last time, okay?}
{3135}{}{I warn you - I'm scary when I'm angry!}

{3145}{}{I never thought I'd do this!}
{3146}{}{You forced me to!}
{3147}{}{Holy shit, I did it!}
{3148}{}{I, uh, am a dangerous criminal. So don't make me mad!}
{3149}{}{Allow me to hurt you, if you don't mind, of course.}
{3150}{}{Yeah, who's afraid of who now?!}
{3151}{}{I didn't want this fight, but...}
{3152}{}{Someone needs a reality check.}
{3153}{}{Y-you, b-be careful!}
{3154}{}{I apologize in advance.}
{3155}{}{A monster is being born within me!}
{3156}{}{Hey, this isn't so hard!}
{3157}{}{Oops, that was an accident.}
{3158}{}{I'm a scoundrel like no other!}

{3162}{}{That wasn't nice at all.}
{3163}{}{Are you sure you know how to handle this?}
{3164}{}{Looks like I got really lucky.}
{3165}{}{What? I'm still alive? I'm alive!}
{3166}{}{You don't really want to kill me? Uh, right?}
{3167}{}{Stop it! I have nothing to do with this!}
{3168}{}{Good thing I'm so agile.}
{3169}{}{That was too close.}
{3170}{}{I knew from the start that you didn't want to kill me.}
{3171}{}{I wasn't hit? I can't believe it.}
{3172}{}{Ha! I'm still alive!}
{3173}{}{Holy shit, that would have hurt if it hit.}
{3174}{}{I'm dying! Dying... Oh, no, false alarm.}
{3175}{}{I'm sneakier than I look! Remember that.}
{3176}{}{Hey! You could have hurt me!}
{3177}{}{Missed? I can't believe my eyes!}
{3178}{}{What a relief - I'm still alive!}
{3179}{}{Just a little bit more...}

{8040}{}{Just don't pass out.}
{8041}{}{That's a crime, you know.}
{8042}{}{Resisting arrest?}
{8043}{}{Guess I'll have to defend myself.}
{8044}{}{This ends with me shooting you.}
{8045}{}{Might go into shock.}

{8089}{}{Ah, my eyes!}
{8090}{}{Ugh! Should have expected that from you.}
{8091}{}{Been through worse.}
{8092}{}{That's low.}
{8093}{}{Stop taunting.}
{8094}{}{This is bad.}

{8107}{}{Your crimes won't be forgotten.}
{8108}{}{These enemies are too tough!}
{8109}{}{Where did these creatures come from...?}
{8110}{}{Damn, we need to retreat.}
{8111}{}{Didn't learn this at Ranger school.}
{8112}{}{Smells worse than a radscorpion nest.}
{8113}{}{I know when to fold.}
{8114}{}{Our snipers will find you later.}

{8122}{}{See what the Wasteland taught me.}
{8123}{}{You're one step away from the grave.}
{8124}{}{I'll make sure you get there.}
{8125}{}{Rangers don't waste time on scum.}
{8126}{}{Guess what we do to people like you.}
{8127}{}{Got a problem with the law, pal?}
{8128}{}{Don't let me down, team!}
{8129}{}{Rangers will restore order here.}
{8130}{}{Stay calm! The Rangers will handle this.}
{8131}{}{You lost your right to live when you chose this path.}
{8132}{}{I know how to deal with you.}
{8133}{}{Our bullets bring mercy.}
{8134}{}{There's no place for you here.}
{8135}{}{I'll teach you to respect the Law.}
{8136}{}{You'll be an example to others.}
{8137}{}{Only one of us walks away.}

{8144}{}{Filthy wasteland scum!}
{8145}{}{You're just a parasite.}
{8146}{}{How does this world tolerate you?}
{8147}{}{The Wasteland will claim your life!}
{8148}{}{Say goodbye!}
{8149}{}{Die with dignity!}
{8150}{}{Trigger finger's itching.}
{8151}{}{Almost feel sorry for you.}
{8152}{}{You deserve this!}
{8153}{}{Get what's coming to you!}
{8154}{}{No person, no problem.}
{8155}{}{I'm a master of this technique.}
{8156}{}{Rangers, move out!}
{8157}{}{You're not the first and won't be the last.}

{8162}{}{Heh, barrel must be bent, huh?}
{8163}{}{Did your granny teach you to aim?}
{8164}{}{That was a lousy tactic, friend.}
{8165}{}{This is amateur hour.}
{8166}{}{Try again.}
{8167}{}{You're pushing your luck!}
{8168}{}{Slow and steady.}
{8169}{}{Maybe, maybe not.}
{8170}{}{Almost got me.}
{8171}{}{Ever heard about that time in...}
{8172}{}{I'll light a cigarette while you regroup.}
{8173}{}{What's the matter? Playing dead?}
{8174}{}{I'm not just standing here like a cactus.}

{16107}{}{No negotiating with types like you.}
{16108}{}{Just savages.}
{16109}{}{I'm a master of scouting, not fighting.}
{16110}{}{Alright, this isn't my part.}
{16111}{}{Damn, if only the paladins were here...}
{16112}{}{I need to find a place to hide...}
{16113}{}{Maybe I can bribe you, huh?}
{16114}{}{Let's wait a little longer.}
{16115}{}{I surrender!}
{16116}{}{Should have stayed in California...}
{16117}{}{Don't kill me! I know a place with heaps of caps!}

{16120}{}{Only one of us will survive.}
{16121}{}{You can't hide from me!}
{16122}{}{I'll find you in any hole in the Wasteland!}
{16123}{}{The intel was accurate!}
{16124}{}{Enemy spotted!}
{16125}{}{The Brotherhood of Steel can't be stopped!}
{16126}{}{I'll do it quickly and quietly.}
{16127}{}{Shouldn't have started what you can't finish.}
{16128}{}{I'm an unmatched scout.}
{16129}{}{Let's see what these natives can do.}
{16130}{}{Time to send your ass to the grave.}
{16131}{}{You have no idea who you're messing with.}
{16132}{}{I'll stop you even with bare hands.}
{16133}{}{Think about yourself and your kids.}
{16134}{}{Now I'll show you some magic, savage.}
{16135}{}{Every enemy has weak points.}
{16136}{}{Someone, cover me!}
{16137}{}{I hope you have stimpaks, savage...}

{16140}{}{Hello.}
{16141}{}{Peekaboo.}
{16142}{}{I'm here.}
{16143}{}{Want to play hide and seek?}
{16144}{}{Take a little nap.}
{16145}{}{There, don't move.}
{16146}{}{Shut your mouth before others hear.}
{16147}{}{Come closer.}
{16148}{}{Submit or die.}
{16149}{}{Don't relax.}
{16150}{}{I have something for you.}
{16151}{}{Oh, someone's about to get hurt!}
{16152}{}{I'll bury you alive in the sand!}
{16153}{}{Take your last breath!}
{16154}{}{No one gets through.}
{16155}{}{Pathetic sight.}
{16156}{}{That's what training means.}

{16161}{}{You fight like a savage.}
{16162}{}{What else could be expected from a savage?}
{16163}{}{Afraid of the fight? Or the consequences?}
{16164}{}{Camouflage didn't fail.}
{16165}{}{It's not for nothing I wear camouflage.}
{16166}{}{You should train more.}
{16167}{}{Just wasting air.}
{16168}{}{Don't waste time.}
{16169}{}{This is simple.}
{16170}{}{Your hands are clumsy.}
{16171}{}{I need to take advantage of this moment.}
{16172}{}{You're far from my training level.}
{16173}{}{You're no fighter. That's for sure.}
{16174}{}{Is that all?}
{16175}{}{You must be seeing double.}
{16176}{}{Alright, I'll give you one more chance.}
{16177}{}{You'd miss even a barn door.}
{16178}{}{You hit like a toothless granny.}
{16179}{}{Right, just pretend you're fighting.}

{17015}{}{Oh dear, my arm won't bend!}
{17016}{}{I can't return fire like this.}

{17033}{}{You're hitting a luminary of science!}
{17034}{}{Savage beast, I'm a scholar!}

{17036}{}{What are you trying to achieve here?}

{17062}{}{Wonderful, now I'll be limping.}
{17063}{}{Will you leave now, perhaps?}
{17064}{}{Only a coward aims for the legs.}
{17065}{}{Not a bad tactic for a savage.}
{17066}{}{See what you've done now?}
{17067}{}{Escape seems improbable now.}

{17104}{}{Need stimpaks urgently.}
{17105}{}{The Brotherhood will be mortified.}
{17106}{}{Stay calm!}

{17124}{}{Please vacate the premises.}
{17125}{}{I'll kill you with this coffee mug.}

{17129}{}{Hey, we have an intruder!}
{17130}{}{I won't pay for your funeral.}
{17131}{}{Harsh measures it is, then.}
{17132}{}{Stop this chaos.}
{17133}{}{Alright, my patience is spent.}
{17134}{}{I wanted to avoid this.}
{17135}{}{Now you'll have to die.}
{17136}{}{I usually refrain from violence, but in your case, I'll make an exception.}

{17145}{}{For the sake of science!}
{17146}{}{Our taxpayers should witness this.}
{17147}{}{Allow me to introduce myself.}

{17150}{}{Die, vermin!}
{17151}{}{Merely reflexes.}
{17152}{}{Take that, you loser.}
{17153}{}{... And one more thing!}

{26038}{}{Something stung me.}
{26039}{}{Such a pathetic attempt to inflict a wound.}
{26040}{}{I'm no longer human.}
{26041}{}{That was ticklish.}
{26042}{}{I imagined my dismantling differently.}
{26043}{}{Another microchip failing.}
{26044}{}{Gotta take some adrenaline.}
{26045}{}{I'm not fast enough.}
{26046}{}{That was a fatal mistake for you.}
{26047}{}{The wound isn't deep.}
{26048}{}{Am I supposed to feel pain?}
{26049}{}{Why is there so much lubricant? Oh, that's blood...}

#  HIT IN LEG

{26060}{}{Hey, this prosthetic is too expensive!}
{26061}{}{I'll replace this leg with a prosthetic.}
{26062}{}{No need to chase you anyway.}
{26063}{}{Lower joint is damaged.}
{26064}{}{This won't stop me.}
{26065}{}{I can't walk.}

#  HIT IN EYES

{26080}{}{Shouldn't have integrated these glasses into my eye sockets.}
{26081}{}{I'll get a new artificial eye.}
{26082}{}{My brothers will restore my sight with prosthetics.}
{26083}{}{I'll regain my vision, you won't.}
{26084}{}{A surgeon will stitch your eyes onto me.}
{26085}{}{You'll ruin my expensive prosthetics.}
{26086}{}{My eye's been ripped out!}
{26087}{}{Someone, put my eye in the fridge.}
{26088}{}{Where's my eye? Where did it roll?}
{26089}{}{If the optic nerve's intact, all is not lost.}

{26090}{}{Thousand parts!}
{26091}{}{Thousand parts and one nut!}
{26092}{}{Bolt and nut, that hurts!}

{26094}{}{So, this is pain.}
{26095}{}{Strange sensations.}
{26096}{}{Your tactics are primitive... but effective.}

{27167}{}{Why start what you can't finish?}
{27168}{}{Savages never learn.}
{27169}{}{This isn't an act of virtue.}
{27170}{}{Do you really crave chaos?}
{27171}{}{The war's long over, yet you keep fighting.}
{27172}{}{I hope that was your best shot.}
{27173}{}{Don't make me fight back.}
{27174}{}{If fights were like this before, there wouldn't have been a Great War.}
{27175}{}{Alright, alright, I believe you.}
{27176}{}{You're risking hurting someone. That's very bad.}
{27177}{}{Look at that inflated ego.}

{32010}{}{Trying to disarm me?}
{32011}{}{I'll just fight with one hand.}
{32012}{}{I've got ANOTHER hand.}
{32013}{}{My bones can take it.}
{32014}{}{So you managed to touch my arm.}
{32015}{}{Holy shit. You actually did it?}
{32016}{}{Good aim. Or just luck.}
{32017}{}{Hit my arm? Not bad.}
{32018}{}{Uh-oh, I kinda need that arm right now.}
{32019}{}{Holding a minigun with one hand is gonna be tough.}
#
#  HIT IN TORSO (GENERIC SHOT/HIT)
#
{32030}{}{Filthy savage...}
{32031}{}{I'm losing my patience, hick.}
{32032}{}{This is getting out of hand.}
{32033}{}{You're only making it worse for yourself.}
{32034}{}{And you call this pain? Pathetic!}
{32035}{}{Damn hayseeds.}
{32036}{}{What do you know about the art of torture?}
{32037}{}{You won't break me.}
{32038}{}{The wound isn't deep.}
{32039}{}{Now I've got a reason to fight.}
#
#  HIT IN LEG
#
{32060}{}{This won't stop me.}
{32061}{}{I'll still get you with my minigun.}
{32062}{}{My lower servo's jammed up.}
{32063}{}{Time to get the armor fixed.}
{32064}{}{Guess I'll be limping for a while.}
{32065}{}{Damn, how'd you manage that?}
{32066}{}{Want to stop me? Try something else.}
{32067}{}{Now it's a bit harder to kick your ass.}
{32068}{}{I'll still get you.}
{32069}{}{That was my leg.}
#
#  HIT IN EYES
#
{32080}{}{M-motherf...!}
{32081}{}{Shot to the eye!}
{32082}{}{Even if I can't see you, I'll kill you.}
{32083}{}{Who's gonna be my eyes here?}
{32084}{}{I'll track you by sound.}
{32085}{}{You're really pissing me off now.}
{32086}{}{This wound's gonna take a while to heal.}

{32093}{}{I was gonna let you live, but now...}
{32094}{}{Filthy, sneaky savage.}
{32095}{}{What else can you expect from these natives?}
{32096}{}{That wasn't the weakest spot in my armor.}
{32097}{}{This armor can take more than that.}
{32098}{}{Nice try.}
{32099}{}{Not very smart of you.}
#
#  RUNNING AWAY

{32100}{}{Damn it, always running low on ammo since '77...}
{32101}{}{How many bullets does it take to kill you?}
{32102}{}{Too much honor to fight you myself.}
{32103}{}{I'll leave you to the Paladins.}
{32104}{}{Let the Paladins handle this.}
{32105}{}{I'm a strategist, not a fighter.}
{32106}{}{Reinforcements!}
{32107}{}{You won this battle, but not the war.}
{32108}{}{I'll get those bastards next time.}
{32109}{}{Take cover!}
{32110}{}{Lose to some peasant? Hell no...}
{32111}{}{What's wrong with these savages?}
{32112}{}{My strategy seemed flawless...}
{32113}{}{Even the Thirteenth fought better.}
{32114}{}{Maybe I'm getting old.}
{32115}{}{This has gone too far.}
{32116}{}{Time to rethink the strategy.}

{32118}{}{You're wasting my time.}
{32119}{}{}
#
#  MOVING IN TO ATTACK

{32123}{}{This will teach you a lesson.}
{32124}{}{This will knock the arrogance out of you.}
{32125}{}{I'll hit you precisely, but hard.}
{32126}{}{Shouldn't have messed with the Brotherhood.}
{32127}{}{Shouldn't have started this war.}
{32128}{}{You can't stop the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{32129}{}{Your existence is a disgrace to humanity.}
{32130}{}{No prisoners!}
{32131}{}{You can't handle me.}
{32132}{}{This is your last day in your short life.}
{32133}{}{You think we're joking around here?}

{32145}{}{Stop wasting my time.}
{32146}{}{You're out of chances.}
{32147}{}{Stand still, you bastard.}
{32148}{}{Your resistance is futile.}

{32150}{}{Don't piss me off.}
{32151}{}{It's been a while since I punched someone.}
{32152}{}{Oh, how I love stretching my fists.}

{32165}{}{Think you can stop the Brotherhood?}
{32166}{}{You can't stop the Brotherhood. Nobody can.}
{32167}{}{Fool! We are the future of Sonora!}
{32168}{}{Idiot! We are the only hope for the Wasteland!}
