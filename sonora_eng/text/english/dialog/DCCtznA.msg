{100}{}{You see a townsperson.}
{101}{}{You see one of the locals.}
{102}{}{ }

{110}{}{Z-z-z}
{111}{}{Hrrr}
{112}{}{. . .}

{120}{}{Highwaymen hit their second caravan this week.}
{121}{}{Those highwaymen show no mercy.}
{122}{}{Heard there were highwaymen spotted nearby.}
{123}{}{The highwaymen could take this whole place if they wanted.}
{124}{}{Fewer caravans now, thanks to the damn Blue Shields.}

{125}{}{How long will this truce with the Blue Shields hold?}
{126}{}{Blue Shields are our friends now? Can't be.}
{127}{}{After what the Blue Shields did, I won't go near 'em.}
{128}{}{Blue Shields trading? World's gone mad.}
{129}{}{Can't trust the Blue Shields. They'll stab us in the back eventually.}

{130}{}{The Blue Shields got what was coming to them.}
{131}{}{Ben and his gang weren't so tough, huh?}
{132}{}{Ben's gang won't be a problem for a while.}
{133}{}{Hope this ends the highwaymen trouble.}
{134}{}{More caravans without Ben's gang around.}

{135}{}{No Ben, no gang. Simple as that.}
{136}{}{Ben got what he deserved.}
{137}{}{Ben used to be a good guy, I 'member.}
{138}{}{Still don't get why Ben turned to banditry.}
{139}{}{Ben's not so scary now. Just a stinking corpse.}

{140}{}{Those Tinsmiths give me the creeps.}
{141}{}{Who'd team up with a machine?}
{142}{}{Tinsmiths look down on us.}
{143}{}{Without Tinsmiths, there'd be fewer caravans.}
{144}{}{At least the Tinsmiths keep the highway safe.}

{145}{}{Less trade now, city's gonna get poorer.}
{146}{}{Fewer caravans without the Tinsmiths.}
{147}{}{Didn't like the Tinsmiths, but they were useful.}
{148}{}{Finally, someone shut down Two-Sun.}
{149}{}{Two-Sun's never gonna rise again. Never.}

{150}{}{The Big City lures folks in, like a moth to a flame.}
{151}{}{Wish I could see Phoenix.}
{152}{}{Heard so much about Phoenix lately.}
{153}{}{They say there's a casino in Phoenix. What's that even like?}
{154}{}{The cap idea came from Phoenix. Never saw that before.}

{155}{}{}
{156}{}{The bathhouse is finally working again.}
{157}{}{Covered in grime since the bathhouse closed.}
{158}{}{Someone's digging up graves at the graveyard. Creepy.}
{159}{}{Mail caravan's delayed. Manager got killed in Phoenix.}

{160}{}{Those cult mummers give me the chills.}
{162}{}{Can't figure out those fire worshippers.}
{163}{}{Fire worshippers, Tinsmiths, Blue Shields... Are we the only sane ones left?}
{161}{}{That cultist offered me writing lessons. Idiots, hehe.}
{164}{}{Fire worshippers seem devout, but they hide knives under those robes.}

{165}{}{Caravanners talk about a big explosion in Phoenix.}
{166}{}{Telling you, the Fire Worshippers' Cathedral is gone.}
{167}{}{Now there's just a big hole where the Cathedral was in Phoenix.}
{168}{}{If you're in Phoenix, steer clear of the cultists.}
{169}{}{Never liked cultists, but trade's gonna suffer without 'em.}

{170}{}{Giant radscorpions spotted on the railroad again.}
{171}{}{Sick of eating just iguanas.}
{172}{}{When will the caravans bring something decent?}
{173}{}{Water alone won't cut it.}
{174}{}{Miss our bar. No one can replace the owner.}
{175}{}{People come and go. But I'm sticking around.}
{176}{}{We need to stick together, or we'll end up like the ones before us.}
{177}{}{Seen the stranger? If he finds out...}
{178}{}{Don't talk about it. Who even cares?}
{179}{}{}

{180}{}{Things went south since that stranger showed up.}
{181}{}{We need to band together and kick that stranger out.}
{182}{}{What's this stranger think he's doing?}
{183}{}{Another stranger blown away like dust.}
{184}{}{Town's getting crowded with all these strangers.}
{185}{}{Best not talk to that stranger.}
{186}{}{Don't like this new guy. Don't like any newbies.}
{187}{}{Things got better since that stranger arrived.}
{188}{}{We owe a lot to that stranger.}
{189}{}{Can't believe all the good that stranger's done.}

{190}{}{Bustos was a tyrant, but without him, the city's weak.}
{191}{}{Everyone feared Count Bustos.}
{192}{}{Bustos is dead. Throne war's coming.}
{193}{}{Sullivan and Bustos at it again?}
{194}{}{Bustos lives high while we scrape by.}
{195}{}{Better not badmouth Count Bustos.}
{196}{}{Anyone who crossed the Count stays quiet.}
{197}{}{Only John Sullivan knew how to fix the water pump.}
{198}{}{Who's running the water pump now?}
{199}{}{Water pump manager was one tough cookie.}
