{100}{}{You see Bart Thur.}
{101}{}{You see the owner of a weapons store. He seems obsessed with guns.}
{102}{}{Ooh, that's power armor! I've heard so much about it, but never seen it...}
{103}{}{Don't touch that. I don't serve drug addicts. Who knows what's going on up there?}

#Start of dialogue
{200}{}{(looks at you closely and with skepticism, assessing the prospects for trade) What kind of weapon do you need, sir? For hunting or to scare off raiders? I've got plenty of guns for any purpose.}
{1200}{}{(looks at you closely and with skepticism, assessing the prospects for trade) What are you looking for, ma'am? There are plenty of weapons here for any purpose and any budget.}
{201}{}{Let me take a look...}
{202}{}{Let me get a closer look at your guns.}

{210}{}{(silently waiting for your cues, lovingly wiping the dust off a weapon)}
{211}{}{Well, I gotta go.}
{212}{}{I see.}

{213}{}{Someone broke into the mercenary guild and killed Bruce Turner.}
{214}{}{Yeah, I know.}
{215}{}{Whoever it is, I hope that bastard gets what he deserves. Because of him, I lost a good client.}
{216}{}{Cheer up, there'll be a new guild probably.}
{217}{}{So you supplied them with weapons? You shouldn't have done that.}

#Questions
{220}{}{Where do you get these weapons?}
{221}{}{Every gun here has a story. This revolver, for example, was sold by an unlucky gambler from the casino. This gun, was taken from local raiders during a camp raid. Caravans bring some from the south. But do you care? The main thing aa gun that won't let you down in a fight.}
{222}{}{What did you say about caravans from the south?}
{223}{}{There's a settlement of Tinsmiths down south. They know a lot about old tech and practically worship it. They've fixed a lot of machines and are now doing repairs and producing things. For example, here's their latest piece... (takes it out and shows it to you)}
{224}{}{[More]}
{225}{}{Pneumatic spear. Works on a spring-piston mechanism. No electronics or gunpowder. (demonstrates the spear with flair) You push against the enemy's body, and - boom! - a little blade shoots out, piercing them. Don't worry, it resets automatically with a return spring. Then it's all about your skill.}
{226}{}{Are they still bringing weapons from the south?}
{227}{}{Some adventurous locals went there and managed a bit of salvage. But sooner or later, that flow will dry up. The main thing is, the Tinsmiths have scattered, and there's no more repair and production being done by them. Their work was vital to all of Phoenix.}

#Product Reveal
{230}{}{What's on those covered shelves?}
{231}{}{My best stuff. But it's for special customers. You're not one of them, yet.}
{232}{}{Why the restriction?}
{233}{}{The Followers of Fire don't like me selling good weapons to just, anybody. They think they'll be used against their church. So all the best goes to them, casino security, bounty hunter guilds, and other trustworthy folks.}
{234}{}{Why cover up some of the goods?}
{235}{}{I want to see your special guns.}
{236}{}{Sorry, but all the best stuff is reserved for special customers. You're not one of them yet.}
{237}{}{Why the restriction?}
{238}{}{Guess I'm wasting my time here then.}
{239}{}{Alright, show me what you have for common folk like me.}

{240}{}{Hmm... Alright then. (opens the goods and spreads his hands with a satisfied look) Here's the best Phoenix has to offer...}
{241}{}{Hell, that's enough to take over a whole city.}
{242}{}{This is what you're saving for your special customers? What a sad sight.}

{243}{}{The fire worshippers are on the run. Their cult won't last. Forget about your agreement.}
{244}{}{I was recently initiated into the Cathedral.}
{1244}{}{I was recently initiated into the Cathedral.}
{245}{}{After so many victories in the ring, am I not trustworthy?}
{246}{}{I'm one of the Arizona Rangers. I need a reliable piece.}
{247}{}{Don Diego recommended your shop to me. Don't let him down.}
{248}{}{Your clients are quite varied, right? [Name the rebel password]}
{249}{}{Come on, you'd make a big profit with me.}
{250}{}{Sounds weak.}
{251}{}{Alright, what about the rest of the weapons?}
{252}{}{Then I'm out of here.}
{253}{}{I have connections all over Arizona. Dealing with me is in your best interests.}
{254}{}{I'm trustworthy. Come on!}
{255}{}{You won't get in trouble because of me. My reputation vouches for itself.}
{256}{}{If you don't sell me the good stuff, I'll just kill you.}
{257}{}{Want me to call in my raiders friends?}
{258}{}{I get it. Show me what you have for ordinary folk then.}
{259}{}{Trust me too. "There are no people more loyal to the emperor than a handful of peasants."}

{260}{}{Anything else?}
{261}{}{Yeah, there's one more thing.}
{262}{}{That's all I need. Bye.}

#Discounts and fines
{280}{}{(upon recognizing you, the seller suddenly perks up) Ahh, it's you. Glad to see you in my store.}
{281}{}{Sounds like a hint for a discount.}
{282}{}{Of course, of course... I always give a small discount to respected folks. Gotta support the city's growth, even in business.}
{283}{}{Great, I'd appreciate it.}
{284}{}{(having recognized you, the seller warily changes his stance, as if expecting a trick) Hey. Need something?}
{285}{}{I'm thinking about buying a weapon...}
{286}{}{Then pick something quickly and get lost. This isn't a raider's den. And remember, assholes like you pay more if you want service.}
{287}{}{Whatever you say, man. Still need a weapon, whatever the price.}
{288}{}{You should treat all your customers well. The world is changing fast.}

{290}{}{Hey, you think you can just show up here after the Cathedral explosion? The townsfolk won't be happy if I keep doing business with you cultists...}
{291}{}{All the more reason I need a weapon for self-defense.}
{292}{}{Hmm, okay. I'll sell you something. But no discounts, got it?}
{293}{}{Caps aren't a problem. Just show me your wares.}
{294}{}{I don't need your pity, or your wares, asshole.}
{295}{}{Looks like I'm not welcome here. I'll go.}

#Education
{300}{}{Can I test fire the gun before buying it? I'd like to work on my shooting skills.}
{301}{}{Pay for ammo and weapon rental, and you can work on your skills at the shooting range as much as you want.}
{302}{}{Here's 500 caps for practising with light weapons.}
{303}{}{Here's 1000 caps for practising with heavy weapons.}
{304}{}{Here's 2000 caps for practising with energy weapons.}
{305}{}{Here's 250 caps for practising with throw weapons.}
{306}{}{I might as well buy my own gun then.}
{307}{}{This is a rip-off. I'm outta here.}
{308}{}{Cough up the caps if you want to improve your skills.}
{309}{}{Okay.}

#Equipment of bullets
{330}{}{I need to modify my ammo.}
{331}{}{I can modify flare ammo and buckshot. No point messing with pistols and rifles.}
{332}{}{[Upgrade flare round]}
{333}{}{[Upgrade modified flare round]}
{334}{}{[Replace buckshot with a 12-gauge bullet]}
{335}{}{1 cap per round. How many do you need?}
{336}{}{2 caps per round. How many do you need?}
{337}{}{Not sure yet. Just wanted to know the prices.}
{338}{}{Too weak, right? They're not designed to hit living targets. But you can strengthen them and make them deadly.}
{339}{}{I don't need this.}

{340}{}{Done. Anything else?}
{341}{}{I still have ammo that needs modifying.}
{342}{}{I might be interested in something other than ammo.}
{343}{}{No, goodbye.}
{344}{}{Something's missing, right? Look around, I have plenty of other goods.}
{345}{}{One round.}
{346}{}{Two rounds.}
{347}{}{Three rounds.}
{348}{}{Four rounds.}
{349}{}{Five rounds.}

#Improving weapons
{350}{}{Do you repair weapons?}
{351}{}{Show me your toys, I'll see what I can do with them.}
{352}{}{Looks like nothing can be done about this.}
{353}{}{Probably not this time.}
{354}{}{}
{355}{}{Got a scope for a hunting rifle?}
{356}{}{I can mount a 10x Unertle sniper scope. Great for long-distance shots. But up close, it won't help you. Quite the opposite, actually.}
{357}{}{How much does it cost?}
{358}{}{ caps. Pay up front.}
{359}{}{I need that scope. Here are the caps and the rifle.}
{360}{}{What's missing?}
{361}{}{Yes, we'll have to put it off.}
{362}{}{(appraises his work with satisfaction and gives you the finished product) Anything else?}
{363}{}{Yeah, don't rush to close.}
{364}{}{No, I don't need anything else.}
{365}{}{I need a larger magazine for the .22 submachine gun.}
{366}{}{Yeah, the small mag for the old .22 just isn't enough. But you're lucky, I have a drum for it that fits real nice.}
{367}{}{I want that drum. Here's the caps and the weapon.}
{368}{}{Any way to make this cattle prod stronger?}
{369}{}{Yeah, I can manage that.}
{370}{}{It's worth it. Do it.}
{371}{}{Got a big magazine for my AK-112?}
{372}{}{Yes, a forty-round mag instead of the usual twenty-four. Just one left.}
{373}{}{Come here.}
{374}{}{Ten rounds.}
{375}{}{All the ammo I have.}
{376}{}{Can you convert the flare gun to a 12-gauge?}
{377}{}{Easy. But remember, it's not a shotgun. Sure, the round is much more powerful than a flare, but firing it one-handed will be a lot tougher.}

#Quests
{400}{}{Did you shoot the monks outside the casino?}
{401}{}{What? Who are you to ask me a question like that?}
{402}{}{Sorry. I'm investigating an attack on behalf of Aaron. Can I ask you a couple of questions?}
{403}{}{I know as much about the attack as you do. And I doubt they used weapons bought from my store.}
{404}{}{Why is that?}
{405}{}{I'm asking the questions, and your answering. Or do you want trouble with the Followers?}
{406}{}{Four people interrogated me before you. I've told them everything I know. I doubt they used weapons from my store.}
{407}{}{That's suspicious. This is the only gun store, right?}
{408}{}{My shop may be the only one in town, but you can get weapons just about anywhere. The most armed people in the city are probably the Followers of Fire themselves. For a while, they were gathering all the guns to stage a revolution. Besides, I supply them with the best weapons - that's our agreement.}
{409}{}{Then who could've attacked the monks?}
{410}{}{You're asking *me*? You're a lousy detective. Talk to the market folk, they saw everything.}
{411}{}{Alright, I'll talk to them. But remember, no one escapes the Followers unpunished.}
{412}{}{Thanks, you've been helpful. Take care.}
