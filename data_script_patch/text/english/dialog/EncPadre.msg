{100}{}{You see Fred Stadtmuller.}
{101}{}{You see a padre in simple, ascetic clothing.}
{102}{}{Farewell, my child.}

{200}{}{Greetings, my son. I didn't expect to meet anyone in the middle of the desert. Are you lost? Do you need help?}
{1200}{}{Greetings, my child. I didn't expect to meet anyone in the middle of the desert. Are you lost? Do you need help?}
{201}{}{Who are you?}
{202}{}{I am Padre Fred Stadtmuller. I travel across Arizona to aid those in need -- whether they are wounded, sick, or lost.}
{203}{}{Nice to meet you, Holy Father.}
{1203}{}{Nice to meet you, Holy Father.}
{204}{}{You're not *my* padre.}
{205}{}{Oh, no, no. Of course, I'm not your padre. Padre is just a title given to men of my rank. I'm sorry if it offended you.}
{206}{}{Okay.}

{210}{}{Is there anything I can do to help you, my child?}
{211}{}{No, I'll manage on my own. All the best, Padre.}

{220}{}{For now, I'd like to talk to you.}
{221}{}{Of course. What do you want to know?}
{222}{}{Let's take a step back.}
{223}{}{Who are you?}
{224}{}{My name is Fred Stadtmuller. I spread the word of God in these lands, much like the clergy of the Catholic Church did before the Great War. Unfortunately, many have forgotten this and see me as just an odd wanderer.}
{225}{}{Another question, please.}
{226}{}{Who granted you this rank, priest?}
{227}{}{I was ordained in a monastic order on the outskirts of Phoenix. This was before Phoenix fell into chaos, and the church resided in the Cathedral of the Holy Fire, avoiding worldly entanglements.}
{228}{}{So you're from the Church of the Holy Fire? Why did you leave?}
{229}{}{There were disagreements with the current ruler of the Cathedral. Our small church once avoided seeking power or wealth, focusing instead on helping the suffering and preserving ancient relics.}
{230}{}{Go on.}
{231}{}{But the Cathedral has changed drastically. I could no longer perform my mass amidst such evil and vice. Now, I conduct my services as the monks of the order did in the past, adhering to the old traditions.}
{232}{}{Well, keep up the good work, Holy Father.}
{233}{}{I guess the Cathedral doesn't like the old traditions.}

{240}{}{How did you learn to control the iron bird?}
{241}{}{Ancient books contain knowledge about aviation, among other things. But why do I have to explain this? Just a few years ago, Phoenix and other settlements were only lit by candlelight. And now? Electric Power has returned thanks to the wisdom of ancient books.}
{250}{}{Yes, I do need your help.}
{251}{}{How can I help you my son?}
{252}{}{Actually, I'd just like to talk.}
{253}{}{Then I won't detain you any longer, Padre.}
{254}{}{I need healing.}
{255}{}{Your body is fine now. As for your soul, that's something you'll have to work on yourself. I must hurry; sick children are waiting for me in the chapel of St. Mary.}
{256}{}{Adios, Padre.}
{257}{}{I want to repent, Holy Father. I have committed many sins.}
{258}{}{I cannot absolve you of your burden entirely, but I can help lighten it. Get down on your knees, my child...}
{259}{}{Thanks, Padre.}
{260}{}{I need all your stuff. Hand over everything, and take off your clothes too.}
{261}{}{May Saint Joseph forgive you...}
{262}{}{Shut up.}
{263}{}{I'm tired of trudging through this desert and want to return to people. Can you take me in your iron bird?}
{1263}{}{I'm tired of trudging through this desert and want to return to people. Can you take me in your iron bird?}
{264}{}{Of course. It won't take long.}
{265}{}{Where would you suggest we go?}
{266}{}{That depends on what your soul desires.}
{267}{}{Give me some time to think.}
{268}{}{I seek revenge for my family. They were taken east of Villa.}
{269}{}{So be it. I think you should go to Garage City or Flagstaff.}
{270}{}{Let's head to Garage City.}
{271}{}{Let's head to Flagstaff.}
{272}{}{No, not now, maybe somewhere else?}
{273}{}{All I need now is to find some good weapons and ammunition. And earn extra money for food.}
{274}{}{Then your path will certainly lead you to Phoenix. It's the largest and most developed city for many miles around.}
{275}{}{Let's head to Phoenix.}
{276}{}{I just want to settle down somewhere quiet.}
{277}{}{I know a place right in the middle of the Sonoran Desert called Casa Nueva. It's a real oasis in the desert.}
{278}{}{Let's head to Casa Nueva.}
{279}{}{I like exploring new lands.}
{280}{}{Then you'll probably want to head south, deep into Mexican territory.}
{281}{}{Let's fly south to the nearest Mexican city.}
