{100}{}{You see Lamont.}
{101}{}{You see a gaunt man with a vacant stare.}
{102}{}{Get out of here while you can... You might still have a chance.}

{200}{}{Who's there? Say something! Please, don't be just in my head... A-and don't touch the weeds! They're dangerous!}
{201}{}{Okay, calm down.}
{202}{}{I'm Lamont. I have a farm in a canyon nearhere. Well, I used to have one.}
{203}{}{Why? Are there weeds there too?}
{204}{}{They're worse than mantises... (glancing around in fear) The weeds - they're everywhere!}
{205}{}{Come on, it's just a tumbleweed...}

{210}{}{Had a farm in that canyon, I did.}
{211}{}{Yes, that's what you said.}
{212}{}{Oh... right. There's nothing left of it now - nothing worth seeing. Best to stay away. But there's nowhere else to go.}
{213}{}{Just a minute. If these weeds are so much trouble, why did you stay?}
{214}{}{Why? Well... curiosity, I suppose. They don't act like normal tumbleweeds. So, I watched 'em... but I watched too long.}
{215}{}{So you can't leave here anymore?}
{216}{}{Nope. Neither me nor you. Nobody's getting out now.}
{217}{}{Are you crazy...}

{220}{}{There's no way out. None. THEY won't allow it.}
{221}{}{Who are "they"?}
{222}{}{Think it all started a couple of weeks back when that... "thing" hit the ground.}
{223}{}{Thing?}
{224}{}{Don't know exactly. Maybe a meteorite. Saw a flash in the sky, then a crash.}
{225}{}{Did you try to find out what it was?}
{226}{}{I went out the next day, but there wasn't even a mark on the ground. Then the strange things began.}
{227}{}{Continue.}
{228}{}{At first, I didn't think much of it - just figured the tumbleweeds got bigger. But then... they started acting alive. Blocking the road, grabbing at my legs when I tried to leave. Haven't tried since...}
{229}{}{Hmm.}
{230}{}{Get away from here while you can. You still have a chance to make it. Run!}
{231}{}{Hmm...}
