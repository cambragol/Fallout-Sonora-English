{100}{}{You see Helford.}
{101}{}{You see one of the field commanders.}
{102}{}{Your reputation among the Rangers has risen due to your efforts in rescuing Jason.}

#First dialogue
{200}{}{(gives you a cursory glance before returning to his reports) You're addressing Field Commander Helford. If you're here to waste my time, you're better off elsewhere. I've got work to do.}
{201}{}{Could you spare a moment for a humble peasant?}
{202}{}{Commander, I'm not here for chitchat.}

#Repeated dialogue
{210}{}{What can I do for you?}
{211}{}{Bye.}
{212}{}{Got it. No need to continue.}
{213}{}{Can I ask you something?}
{214}{}{Go ahead.}
{215}{}{I have another question.}

#Questions
{220}{}{How did you become a Ranger?}
{221}{}{Started young, honed my skills in the desert, put in the time. Serve as long as I have, and maybe you'll earn that field captain title too.}
{222}{}{What is this place?}
{223}{}{This is the main Ranger base. Command center's in the dam's power plant; training happens here, along with "diplomatic" meetings.}
{224}{}{What kind of "diplomatic" meetings?}
{225}{}{Trade talks, negotiations. We're restoring order in this region, and that means forming alliances.}
{226}{}{I don't know much about the Rangers. Can you tell me a bit?}
{227}{}{We're elite fighters and survivalists. Our skills let us enforce law and order in the Wastes. Bringing back order is our main mission.}
{228}{}{And you do this for free?}
{229}{}{Our territories get taxed, and have rules, a 'Law'. Refuse to play by them, and we refuse to help.}
{230}{}{What's this "Law" you're talking about?}
{231}{}{Basic rules, regulations, etc. Break 'em, face the consequences, often lethal ones.}

#Ranger -- Jackals
{233}{}{Thanks for aiding in the search. Jackals drained our brother dry; glad they paid for it.}
{234}{}{No need. We found our patrol's remains at the Jackals' lair up north. I think you know the place.}
{235}{}{I didn't see that coming. Unfortunate.}
{236}{}{How do I track the missing patrol?}
{237}{}{You could radio for their last known position, ask around nearby settlements, or venture into the desert and hope for the best.}
{238}{}{I'm hoping it doesn't come to that; wandering blind doesn't sound fun.}

{239}{}{Maybe not the best timing, but the Jackals are ready to form an alliance.}
{240}{}{What?! Out of the question! The Jackals are cunning and aggressive; they're not open to negotiation. Any offer's a trick to benefit them. The general would agree.}
{241}{}{The Rangers from the northern patrol are dead. They were killed by the Jackals.}
{242}{}{Damn it... I had a gut feeling it would turn out this way. Those savages have spilled too much of our brothers' blood. But thank you for finding out what happened. I'll send a report to the general.}
{243}{}{You're welcome.}
{244}{}{A Ranger from the northern patrol returned. Though he's alone.}
{245}{}{I've already been informed. Excellent work, Ranger. Keep it up.}
{246}{}{Got word. Solid work, civilian. You've got what it takes; we could use more like you. Keep it up.}
{1246}{}{Got word. Solid work, civilian. You've got what it takes; we could use more like you. Keep it up.}
{247}{}{You're welcome.}
{248}{}{What do you think of the Jackals?}
{249}{}{The Jackals are one of the most disgusting tribes in the Wasteland. They've become so feral that you can't even tell their kids apart from dogs. It breaks my heart to see a whole nation fall to such a state. Cannibalism, a ridiculous cult, hostility to all outsiders, even neighboring clans - can they sink any lower?}

#Family of a criminal
{250}{}{How do you justify killing that woman's husband?}
{251}{}{Ah, that dame got her hooks into you too? Listen, her husband was a criminal. He was robbing farmers and attacking travelers. For all that, he was justly executed according to the Law. Nobody even thought he had a family.}
{252}{}{[More]}
{253}{}{For you, it's just a story. And for me, honestly, too. But you have no idea what a furious radscorpion female can do. Something has to be done about this.}
{254}{}{[More]}
{255}{}{Maybe you can talk some sense into her. No offense, but you look more like a local than a Ranger. You might earn her trust easier.}
{256}{}{What needs to be done?}
{257}{}{Just explain to her that she's no longer welcome in these lands. It'll be better for everyone if she takes her kid and leaves.}
{258}{}{Alright, I'll try.}
{259}{}{I won't get involved in others' problems.}
{260}{}{Looks like you handled her well. Good work. Here, take some ammo from me as thanks.}
{261}{}{Thanks.}
{262}{}{Hold up. Heard a sad story. Ferryman's dead, and you were last seen with the refugees on the ferry. Bit of a coincidence, wouldn't you say?}
{263}{}{I, uh, had nothing to do with it.}
{264}{}{I hope so. Because sooner or later, our guys will uncover the truth. And you know how we uphold the Law, especially so close to our citadel.}
{265}{}{Of course, uh, I'm sure you'll find the culprits. Now, I gotta go...}

#Farm spy
{270}{}{I want to report a spy. He's hiding in the basement of a shack on the old road...}
{271}{}{Thanks for the tip. Scouts will head there, catch him off-guard. Time to deal with the bastard.}
{272}{}{Good luck.}
{273}{}{Did you hear about the missing weapon from the quartermaster?}
{274}{}{No, and it's not my concern. Got bigger fish to fry.}
{275}{}{Alright.}

#Stop-dialogue
{280}{}{Damn... You're like those... Reavers from down south. No offense, but you should watch your back in public.}
{281}{}{Got it. It's not the first time.}

{282}{}{You have the gall to show your face after what you did?}
{283}{}{He sold me junk.}
{284}{}{And you're okay with killing over that? Damn, punishment should match the crime, don't you think?}
{1284}{}{And you're okay with killing over that? Damn, punishment should match the crime, don't you think?}
{285}{}{No, not really.}
{286}{}{I deeply regret my actions.}
{287}{}{His guard attacked me first.}
{288}{}{His dimwit son? We knew he was trouble, but fights were rare. I'll take your word for it. But couldn't you just walk away?}
{289}{}{Flick? What are you talking about?}
{290}{}{You expect me to believe you know nothing about this? And had nothing to do with the trader's death? Hard to disprove without witnesses, I suppose.}
{1290}{}{You expect me to believe you know nothing about this? And had nothing to do with the trader's death? Hard to disprove without witnesses, I suppose.}
{291}{}{That's how it went down, commander.}
{292}{}{(shakes head) Wasteland folk... Lucky no one saw, and Flick's rep wasn't spotless. You're clear. But remember, we're here to keep the peace.}
{293}{}{Got it, commander.}
{294}{}{Well, I hope so. I'll believe you for now, but don't forget, we're here to keep the peace. You're dismissed.}
{295}{}{Thank you, commander.}
{296}{}{Um...}
{297}{}{Alright, let's hear what happened between you and Flick.}

#Defending the Villa
{300}{}{I'm here on behalf of Villa. We need the Rangers' help.}
{301}{}{I'm looking for help in freeing Villa's farmers from slavery.}
{302}{}{The farmers of Villa still need help.}
{303}{}{(frowning, looks up from his reports) The Villa - that's the oasis where they're somehow growing corn in the middle of the desert, right? I sympathize with you. Times are tough for many. The threat from Phoenix is spreading across Arizona, enslaving people and seizing resources.}
{304}{}{I remember our discussion about the Villa.}
{305}{}{So, will you help?}

{306}{}{We're stretched thin. All our forces are elsewhere.}
{307}{}{That's a shame.}
{308}{}{Looks like no help from the Rangers then.}
{309}{}{}
{310}{}{First, complete my assignments, as we agreed. Until then, no audience with the general or pulling folks from their missions.}
{311}{}{I've finished all your tasks.}
{1311}{}{I've finished all your tasks.}
{312}{}{Seems you have. Honestly, didn't expect it. Gave you the tasks to keep you out of my hair. Good to see you're diligent.}
{313}{}{Go on.}
{314}{}{But about Villa... the general needs to handle it. Go see him. Guards will let you through. Outcome's up to him now.}
{315}{}{Thanks, commander.}
{316}{}{Alright. But if this turns out to be all for nothing, I'll blame you.}

{320}{}{The general's sending help to Villa.}
{321}{}{Damn. You convinced the old man? We've bigger fish to fry than saving some uppity peasants. Always saw us as raiders, didn't you? But orders are orders. Villa gets our protection now.}
{322}{}{Frankly, not thrilled with this deal. You lot at Villa always saw us as raiders. And now you come running when things get tough. But promise is a promise - Villa's under our wing. Hope this leads to something useful.}
{323}{}{I hear you, commander. Let's hope for the best.}
{324}{}{With that attitude, it's no wonder the Rangers have few friends. Goodbye... "friend."}

#Story quests
{330}{}{Maybe I can help somehow?}
{331}{}{Usually *we* do the helping... But in this case, any aid's welcome. Even from a peasant like you.}
{1331}{}{Usually *we* do the helping... But in this case, any aid's welcome. Even from a peasant like you.}
{332}{}{What needs to be done?}

{333}{}{Talk to the comms officer at the radio station. She needed some parts. Once you've sorted that out, come back to me.}
{334}{}{Sounds easy enough, I'll handle it.}
{335}{}{Sounds time-consuming, but I'll do it.}

{336}{}{That's not all. There's a town called Quartz to the south. A group of settlers recently moved in, but our scouts report they've all disappeared. Find out what happened there. Oh, and our cartographer wants info from there. Talk to him too.}
{337}{}{I'll figure out what happened there.}
{338}{}{So you're dumping your work on me. Got it.}

{340}{}{One more thing. Lost a scout group in the Mojave to the north. Can't spare anyone to find them. See what you can dig up.}
{341}{}{Consider it done.}
{342}{}{I'll think about it if I'm up that way.}

{343}{}{Excellent, I'm waiting on results. Dismissed.}
{344}{}{[Leave]}

{350}{}{About those tasks...}
{351}{}{Report in.}
{352}{}{Honestly, there's not much to report.}

{353}{}{The radio station went offline. It wasn't my doing.}
{354}{}{(irritated) I'm aware. You're not proving helpful at all! (calms down) Alright... I'll take your word that it wasn't your fault. Aligning with the Rangers is in your best interest, after all.}
{355}{}{Sorry for the, uh... trouble.}
{356}{}{Watch your tone. I told you it wasn't my fault.}
{357}{}{Can you explain how to fix the radio station?}
{358}{}{Talk to the comms officer about that. I just need to know if it's working again.}
{359}{}{Understood, I'll talk to her.}
{360}{}{The radio's back up. I managed to tinker with it.}
{361}{}{Good job. Expanding our broadcasting range will aid our Rangers, both in peace and war. That's been a sore spot for us. But I heard there were complications.}
{362}{}{There were. Someone was intercepting our transmissions.}
{363}{}{Intercepting our broadcasts, huh? Not surprising. We've made enemies in our fight against crime. What's odd is someone else mastering broadcast tech. Unlikely for some random wasteland gang. Your info could be valuable. Take this hunting rifle. You've earned it. Might need it as you help us more.}
{364}{}{Glad to be of service.}
{1364}{}{Glad to be of service.}
{365}{}{Here's to future cooperation.}
// added by cambragol for mid-way feedback
{366}{}{Radio's nearly fixed. Just working on possible interference with the signal.}
{367}{}{Report back when it's done.}
{368}{}{Got it.}



{370}{}{I've got news on Quartz.}
{371}{}{Well, spill it, then.}
{372}{}{Locals got themselves irradiated, went nuts.}
{373}{}{This holotape's got the full story.}
{374}{}{Uh, actually, I don't know.}
{375}{}{(sighs) Foolishness. This is what happens when folks mess with pre-war tech. They set-off something they didn't understand. Lost their minds for it.}
{376}{}{And yet they were close to unlocking it.}
{377}{}{Maybe so. At least now it's contained.}
{378}{}{Well done. We'll set up warnings and inform patrols. Grateful for your help.}
{1378}{}{Well done. We'll set up warnings and inform patrols. Grateful for your help.}
{379}{}{No problem.}
{380}{}{Glad to be of help.}

{390}{}{I need to report Ranger Garth's crimes.}
{391}{}{Aren't you stretching a bit? I hear all sorts of rumors about Rangers. Garth's got a good record. Honestly, I've got bigger fish to fry. Leave it be.}
{392}{}{Umm...}
{393}{}{Garth, a criminal? Surprising. So many awards... It's peace that's done this to him. Retirement breeds paranoia. Hope it's not contagious.}
{394}{}{We all have our struggles. Even you, commander.}
{395}{}{His story's a lesson. For the Rangers, and you too, commander.}

#Additional quests
{400}{}{I'd like to keep helping the Rangers.}
{401}{}{That's the spirit. We can always use more hands, legs, and eyes.}
{402}{}{Alright, I'll find something to do.}
{403}{}{Unfortunately, I'm not heading that way. Got anything else?}

{410}{}{I can help with long-range scouting.}
{411}{}{That would be immensely helpful. We've lost contact with one of our scout groups in the Mojave Desert to the north. No one available for a rescue operation right now. Investigate their whereabouts.}
{412}{}{I'll do my best to find them.}
{413}{}{If I'm in the area, I'll look into it.}
{414}{}{Awaiting your report.}
{415}{}{Got any other tasks for me?}
{416}{}{I'll take my leave for now.}

{420}{}{Looking for someone to handle negotiations?}
{421}{}{Got just the task. We were expecting refugees from the east, but they headed for Garage City instead. Since you're likely heading there, find out why they changed course.}
{422}{}{Alright. I'll see what's going.}

{430}{}{I found the refugees in Garage City, but they were already dead when I arrived.}  
{431}{}{Damn. What happened?}  
{432}{}{They were killed like dogs. Locals don't take kindly to outsiders.}  
{433}{}{Seems like they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.}  
{434}{}{I have no idea.}  
{435}{}{Even scavengers these days are willing to commit crimes out of hatred for outsiders. As you can see, this world needs a steady hand to keep people from crossing that line.}  
{436}{}{Indeed.}
{437}{}{Thanks for lightening our workload a little.}
{438}{}{Glad to be of assistance.}
{439}{}{I'm doing it to help Villa.}
{440}{}{Found the refugees in Garage City. They were intimidated by someone posing as a Ranger.}
{441}{}{Someone impersonating us?}
{442}{}{Exactly. Here's the imposter's badge. He won't cause any more trouble.}
{443}{}{Criminals stoop to any low to achieve their goals. I'm sure he had plenty of 'justifications' for his actions.}
{444}{}{Yeah.}
{445}{}{This isn't the first attempt to tarnish our reputation. Forces in the north despise us for our actions. But the landscape is changing; criminals are no longer just fighting for survival but organized and sponsored. Nevertheless, we'll handle this threat too.}

{450}{}{I'm planning to stay close to base. Any nearby tasks?}
{451}{}{Their are reports of some kind of... sickness, in the Aqueduct, the community on the banks of the Colorado, a little ways east of here. Investigate and see how we can assist.}
{452}{}{I'm on it, commander.}

{453}{}{I've discovered the cause of the sickness - Flick's radioactive goods.}
{454}{}{Flick's selling radioactive stuff? There've been rumors, but no one could ever prove his guilt.}
{455}{}{He won't be bothering anyone but earthworms now.}
{456}{}{Ah, I see justice caught up with him before we could. Thank you for the information. We'll handle the situation from here.}
{457}{}{My pleasure.}
{458}{}{Goodbye.}
{459}{}{He won't escape this time.}
{460}{}{Right. Flick's already headed out into the wasteland with his crew. Catch him before he gets too far. Deal with his radiated goods by any means necessary.}
{461}{}{Got it.}
{462}{}{Off to the desert once again...}
{463}{}{Flick won't be causing any more trouble. He's dealing with the consequences now.}
{464}{}{Flick's dead? Didn't expect you to go that far. But thanks for taking care of the problem.}
{465}{}{Goodbye.}
{466}{}{Flick's lost his goods. A lesson he won't soon forget.}
{467}{}{Excellent job! Flick's a troublesome figure, but indispensable as a trader. It's fortunate he only lost his goods. Here, take these supplies as thanks. (Hands over two stimpaks and an antidote) You can sell them if you don't need them.}
{468}{}{Thanks.}
{1468}{}{Thanks.}
{469}{}{Not the greatest reward, but better than nothing.}
