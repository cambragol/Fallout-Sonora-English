{100}{}{You see a messenger in front of you.}
{101}{}{You see a man with a knife in his side. He won't last long.}
{102}{}{You see a wounded man. He's barely standing, clutching his wounded side.}
{103}{}{...Bruce's mercenaries... they were the ones who attacked...}
{104}{}{I was desperate, thought I was done for. Thanks, doc.}

{110}{}{...I'm hurt...}
{111}{}{...Ahh... the pain...}
{112}{}{...S-save... me...}
{113}{}{...I'll tell you everything, just help me...}
{114}{}{...They ambushed us... they were waiting for us...}
{115}{}{Help me, please!}
{116}{}{Okay... okay... I'll tell you...}
{117}{}{...It was Bruce's mercenaries...}
{118}{}{...They took... the Red Cardinal... and...}
{119}{}{...Ar-rh...}
{120}{}{Sorry, friend, but help's not coming in time.}

{200}{}{Thanks, Doc. I owe you one.}
{201}{}{Who attacked you?}
{202}{}{It was mercenaries from Bruce's guild. I think they set us up. They grabbed the guy I was meeting, one of the Red Cardinals, stabbed me, and left me for dead.}
{203}{}{How did you get mixed up in this?}
{204}{}{I'm just a city guy without a job. Someone asked me to deliver a note, that's it. I don't know anything else.}
{205}{}{There's no such thing as an easy job. Remember that. Now I need to pay the mercenary guild a visit.}
{206}{}{Sorry, buddy. Tough day for you. Goodbye.}
{207}{}{Goodbye.}
