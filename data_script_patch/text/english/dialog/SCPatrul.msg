{100}{}{You see Paladin Latham.}
{101}{}{You see a strong, unshaven man.}
{102}{}{Well, no, not now.}
{103}{}{?}

{200}{}{Hold it. This is a restricted area. No civilians allowed on the base.}
{201}{}{Civilians? What are you, some kind of army?}
{202}{}{Not exactly. We are the Brotherhood of Steel, an ancient miltary order. So we do keep military discipline.}
{203}{}{Got it. And who are you?}
{204}{}{Amazing. Who do I have the honor of speaking to?}
{205}{}{I am Paladin Latham, Chief of Patrol. Any more questions?}
{206}{}{No, uh... sir.}
{207}{}{Oh, I have plenty of questions, but you probably won't answer them.}
{208}{}{Alright then, amigo, what brings you to us?}
{1208}{}{Alright then, amiga, what brings you to us?}
{209}{}{I'm from a village up north. Slave traders attacked us, and I'm trying to save my kin who were captured...}
{210}{}{You're exactly what I've been looking for. Most of my village has been captured by slavers, and I'm trying to free them...}
{211}{}{I'm sorry, but I can't bother the general about some village. We don't have time for that.}
{212}{}{No, you misunderstood. *You're* the slave traders. I'm here to free my kin and wipe you out!}
{213}{}{What's going on? What's all the commotion?}
{214}{}{I see you won't help me. Can I go, Paladin?}
{215}{}{You again? I told you, we can't deal with your village right now. We have bigger issues.}
{216}{}{Enemies from the south, mutants in the west, chaos in the east. We lost a squard up north and can't even send a rescue mission.}
{217}{}{What if I helped you find this squad? Would you let me see the general then?}
{218}{}{Help us? A peasant helping the Brotherhood? Haha, did you hear that, guys? Alright, let's see what you've got.}
{1218}{}{Help us? A peasant woman helping the Brotherhood? Haha, did you hear that, guys? Alright, let's see what you've got.}
{219}{}{What's the deal with the squad?}
{220}{}{To the north-west are ruins we call Inferno. A convoy, led by our squad, was passing through the vicinity, but we suddenly lost contact. No idea what happened to them.}
{221}{}{I see. Anything else?}
{222}{}{No. You'll have to go there and find out what happened. Be careful though, scribes say there are high radiation levels around Inferno.}
{223}{}{Okay. I'll do it.}
{224}{}{I'll go. But I'll be back, Paladin.}
{225}{}{Another mutant... When will it end?}
{226}{}{Hey, I'm standing right here.}
{227}{}{Oh, not anytime soon, my smoothskinned friend...}

{230}{}{What do you need?}
{231}{}{Nothing. Goodbye.}
{232}{}{What do you want, brother?}

{240}{}{I need to know more about Inferno.}
{241}{}{Not much to say. The scribes claim it's a dead zone, all thanks to a nuke blast. They warn about the radiation, too.}
{242}{}{What about the convoy?}
{243}{}{Several Brotherhood members were carrying important cargo from California. They should've reported back long ago.}
{244}{}{Thanks, that's enough.}
{245}{}{I guess that'll have to do.}
{246}{}{Allow me a bit more of your time, Paladin.}
{247}{}{I know what happened in Inferno...}
{248}{}{...It's true then, what the scribes said -- it's a cursed place. You need to talk to our general.}
{249}{}{The general himself?}
{250}{}{He'll be interested in your story. I'll tell the guards to let you through.}
{251}{}{Great.}
{252}{}{Finally.}
{253}{}{Hold on. WHERE did you get that Power Armor?}
{254}{}{Practically in hell. Dead people on the streets, wild Reavers eating each other, ruins everywhere...}
{255}{}{Sounds like Inferno, where our convoy disappeared. Did you find someone in this armor? A body?}
{256}{}{Let me tell you what I know...}
{257}{}{I don't have to tell you anything. This is mine and I'm keeping it.}

{260}{}{Anything else I can do for the Brotherhood?}
{261}{}{You mentioned an enemy army?}
{262}{}{Yes, we've seen units moving from the south up to the Mexican border. We know little about them. Even their HQ is unknown.}
{263}{}{But there's only desert to the south. Where's their base?}
{264}{}{We don't know. But the desert is a natural barrier, keeping them out of Arizona. For now.}
{265}{}{I hope you can stop them. Adios.}
{266}{}{I can find out. Always wanted to see those parts.}
{267}{}{I can scout the southern lands if it'll help.}
{268}{}{We sent scouts south, but none returned. Still want to try? Go ahead. We'll pay for intel on the Mexican Army's plans.}
{269}{}{I'll be back with something.}
{270}{}{There's a Mexican Army fort in Hermosillo...}
{271}{}{...Nice work! Your intel will give us an edge if there's an attack.}
{272}{}{Hermosillo's pretty far across the desert. Doubt they'll reach here anytime soon.}
{273}{}{Don't care why you need it. Just a trade.}
{274}{}{Here's your payment. We value good intel.}
{275}{}{Thanks.}
{276}{}{That guy you helped? He was in rough shape. What's the story there?}
{277}{}{Pancho said you need info on the Mexican army.}
{278}{}{Did you scout around there? What did you find out?}
{1278}{}{Did you scout around there? What did you find out?}
{279}{}{Nothing useful. If I go again, I'll get more intel.}

{280}{}{I need a favor. Take Initiate Corwin on your next patrol.}
{281}{}{Corwin? Why doesn't he pull his weight?}
{282}{}{He's been begging for shore leave for ages.}
{283}{}{Ah, here's the thing. First, we don't need dead weight on the patrol. And second, I'm not swayed by the words of a drifter like you.}
{284}{}{A drifter, huh? Fine...}
{285}{}{Here's the thing. First, we don't need extra baggage on the patrol. And second, your authority here means nothing. I don't know you well enough to grant your request.}
{286}{}{I get it...}
{287}{}{Here's the thing. I only listen to requests from those who've proven their worth. Tell Corwin I'll take him on patrol to Casa Nueva and back. It's not exactly shore leave, but it'll give him some fresh air.}
{288}{}{Thank you, Paladin Latham. You've been very helpful.}
{289}{}{Here's a holotape with data from the headquarters computer. It's in Spanish.}

{300}{}{What exactly does your service do?}
{301}{}{We're patrol. We keep order in the surrounding area. Any more questions?}
{302}{}{No, sir.}
{303}{}{Yes, I have a couple.}
{304}{}{I get that. But we're surrounded by desert. What kind of order can be maintained out here?}
{305}{}{We protect the caravan routes primarily. There are fishing settlements on the coast under our watch. Sometimes, Casa Nueva sends requests. And yes, even in this wasteland, there are raiders. We must always be on guard.}
{306}{}{I see.}
{307}{}{Interesting. Will you take me on patrol?}
{308}{}{Taking a stranger on patrol is a risky move. Even if your intentions are pure.}
{309}{}{Alright. Maybe you'll change your mind if I prove myself.}
{310}{}{You probably need experienced mercenaries. You said yourself that you're short on people.}
{311}{}{Hmm... Yes, but you don't exactly look like battle-tested material. Set your sights a little lower.}
{312}{}{Yes, but you... Hmm... Well, we're actually short on people for a big operation we were planning.}
{313}{}{Great. Tell me what needs to be done.}
{314}{}{Take me on patrol.}
{315}{}{The General mentioned you. I'd be glad if you help us with a tough operation.}
{316}{}{Of course. Tell me what's needed.}
{317}{}{Is there anything else I can do to help the Brotherhood?}
{318}{}{After Hermosillo, I want to help the Brotherhood even more. Will you take me on patrol?}
{319}{}{Yeah, we need more people like you for a major operation.}
{320}{}{Great. I'm all ears.}
{321}{}{Raiders have been a thorn in our side lately. They're targeting the main trade routes and local settlements. They recently hit one of our caravans, and this can't go unanswered.}
{322}{}{They don't know who they're messing with, Paladin Latham.}
{323}{}{These must be some serious guys to rob a Brotherhood caravan.}
{324}{}{We tracked those raiders back to one of their desert camps. Time to pay them a visit and put an end to their attacks once and for all.}
{325}{}{Great. When do we move out?}
{326}{}{Go to the rally point I marked on the map. Field Commander Dobbs will meet you there and brief you. And make sure you're well-armed. Good luck.}
{327}{}{Got it. Heading out now.}
{1327}{}{The mission is clear. I'm leaving immediately.}
{328}{}{I'll head there, uh, soon.}
{329}{}{Take me on patrol, Paladin Latham.}

{330}{}{Here's my report on the highwaymen camp raid...}
{331}{}{...Very good. That was just a small field camp. After hitting the caravan, the raiders split up. The second group took the loot to their main base. Securing the caravan was crucial, but retrieving the stolen cargo is even more vital.}
{332}{}{So there's another mission?}
{333}{}{We don't know the location of the main base. But during the raid, we got intel on a large camp in the ruins of Caborca. That camp must be destroyed, and it might have information about the main base.}
{334}{}{What are your orders, sir?}
{335}{}{Report to Commander Dobbs for your next assignment.}
{336}{}{Yes, Paladin Latham.}
{337}{}{If we have no other leads, what option do we have?}
{338}{}{Did I ask your opinion? Hmm... Never mind. You're doing a good job. It'd have been tougher without you.}
{339}{}{What are your orders, sir?}
{340}{}{...Turns out the camp in Caborca was set up just to attack our caravan routes. The main base is in the eastern mountains. No wonder it took us so long to locate them.}
{341}{}{So, you're going to hit their headquarters?}
{342}{}{Headquarters? They're just a bunch of common raiders. Call it a base or a hideout.}
{343}{}{Understood, sir.}
{344}{}{Relay the order to attack to the commander. This mission's gonna be rougher than the last ones. Tell him to bring his top soldiers. And you - make sure you're packing your best weapons and armor. Good luck, soldier.}
{345}{}{Yes, Paladin Latham.}
{346}{}{...So we hit their main base. The raiders were wiped out, the leaders executed, and the loot returned to the Brotherhood. Well done, warrior.}
{347}{}{The wastelands will remember this day.}
{348}{}{It was a glorious victory! We've purged these lands of evil and shown our strength once more. With the raiders defeated, the roads will be safer, and the Brotherhood's fame will spread further. Thank you for your service.}
{349}{}{Hail to the Brotherhood of Steel!}
{350}{}{I want to file a complaint. I was kicked out of Commander Dobbs' unit!}
{351}{}{And rightfully so. If it weren't for your past actions, you'd be facing the full force of our military justice. Best thing for you now is to get off our base.}
{352}{}{Yes, sir.}
{353}{}{Damn it!}
{354}{}{I have bad news - Commander Dobbs was killed during the operation.}
{355}{}{What? That's a real blow. He was our best field commander, and the only one who had the full grasp of the situation. Without him, taking down the raiders just got a whole lot tougher.}
{356}{}{What about the operation?}
{357}{}{We'll have to put the operation on hold and regroup. Not sure when we'll need you again, but we will. In the meantime, you're free to go.}
{1357}{}{We'll have to suspend the operation and reorganize our forces. I don't know when we'll need you, but we will eventually. Until then, you're free.}
{358}{}{Yes, sir.}

{360}{}{I need gear for the raid.}
{361}{}{Your gear is your own responsibility. All I can do is grant you access to the quartermaster's supplies. Talk to him, maybe you can trade for something better.}
{362}{}{Thanks for that.}
