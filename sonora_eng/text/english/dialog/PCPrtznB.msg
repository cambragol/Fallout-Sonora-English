{100}{}{You see Elisa.}
{101}{}{You see a woman with a look of absolute determination. Trying to change her mind would be a lost cause.}
{102}{}{You're in my sights. But let Marcos decide what to do with you.}
{103}{}{It's because of you that we failed our mission!}
{104}{}{We won thanks to you. Thank you.}

# Dialogue
{200}{}{Marcos might've cleared you to be here, but that doesn't mean you've earned our trust. Prove it with your actions, and watch what you say.}
{201}{}{Of course, I understand.}
{202}{}{It's hard to build trust with a welcome like this.}

{210}{}{Greetings, brother. How can I help you?}
{1210}{}{Greetings, sister. How can I help you?}
{211}{}{See you, sister.}

{220}{}{Tell me about yourself.}
{221}{}{Well, we don't talk about our pasts really. We're here for a common cause, not for socializing.}
{222}{}{How did you get involved in this movement?}
{223}{}{I see, sorry.}
{224}{}{It doesn't matter. I'll just say that initially, I had personal motives. Now, I'm fighting for an ideal that's much greater.}
{225}{}{Interesting. Mind if I ask one more thing?}
{226}{}{Tell me about Marcos.}
{227}{}{He's a great man.}
{228}{}{Um, is that all?}
{229}{}{Well, he has a dark past. I only know that before creating the Party, he experienced some kind of tragedy.}
{230}{}{Are you in love with him?}
{231}{}{Wha... how... Look, I admire him as a leader. After all, he united so many people under a noble cause. But I've never seen his face; he never takes off his balaclava in front of me.}
{232}{}{Thanks for such a, uh, detailed answer.}
{233}{}{I see. Thanks for the answer.}
{234}{}{What are you doing here?}
{235}{}{This is our headquarters. It's where we plan, store, and prepare equipment.}
{236}{}{Can I use your workbenches?}
{237}{}{I don't mind if it helps our common fight.}
{238}{}{Thanks.}
{239}{}{What is this place?}
{240}{}{This used to be an underground train station. The passages collapsed during the Great War, leaving only the exit to the sewers. That's why few people know about this place.}

# Issue of Equipment
{250}{}{I need gear for this mission.}
{251}{}{Alright. Marcos says you're trustworthy. Check our supplies. What do you need?}
{252}{}{Nothing now. I'll come back later.}
{253}{}{If that's not enough, head to the gun store downtown. The owner deals with us secretly. Use the code phrase: "No people are more loyal to the emperor than a handful of peasants."}
{254}{}{Got it. I'm off on the mission. Later, Elisa.}
{255}{}{}
{256}{}{Just what I needed.}
{257}{}{Sniper gear.}
{258}{}{Here's a hunting rifle and a box of ammo. This should be enough.}
{259}{}{Assault gear.}
{260}{}{Going in guns blazing, huh? Okay, you and Marcos know best. Here's a submachine gun, a box of 10mm rounds, a couple of grenades, and a stimpak in case you get hit.}
{261}{}{Spy gear.}
{262}{}{Alright, let's see. A flare for dark areas, stealth boy for sneaking, and some explosives for emergencies. Take a stimpak too, just in case your cover's blown.}

{270}{}{Are you the local explosives expert? I could use some pointers.}
{271}{}{Sorry, but I don't have time for lessons.}
{272}{}{I can pay in caps. It'll cover your trouble.}
{273}{}{Alright, seeing as caps can fund our Party's work, and save time, I'll do it. But first you get me 350 caps, then I'll teach you what I know.}
{274}{}{Agreed. I'll be back with the caps.}
{275}{}{Nevermind then.}
{276}{}{Considering I saved one of your pals, you might cut me some slack.}
{277}{}{Fair point. Sorry, it's hectic right now. Still, a hundred caps donation would be fair.}
{278}{}{Here's a hundred caps...}
{279}{}{Here's 350 caps...}

# Tasks
{300}{}{Marcos want me to go topside. What's the job?}
{301}{}{Listen up. One of our agents went to the surface ruins to set up a signal booster. We lost contact with him. Find him and finish his job.}
{302}{}{Why do you need a signal booster up there?}
{303}{}{We use radio for our communications and to spy on cultists. But underground, the signal's too weak. We need a booster on the surface.}
{304}{}{Got it. I'm heading topside.}
{305}{}{Can I get gear for this?}
{306}{}{It's a simple run through the ruins. If you can't handle it, how did you even get here? Besides, Marcos didn't approve any gear for you.}
{307}{}{Got it. See you later.}
{308}{}{If I die, it's on you.}

{310}{}{Where exactly should I search for the agent?}
{311}{}{Go to the main sewer and head west. You need to reach the old city ruins near Union Station. Hope you don't get lost.}
{312}{}{Let's talk about my mission.}
{313}{}{Anything to report?}
{314}{}{Nothing yet. I'll get on it now.}
{315}{}{About that agent. He's dead.}
{316}{}{Damn... That's bad. What about the signal booster?}
{317}{}{Not sure yet.}
{318}{}{The booster is set up. You can check the signal strength.}
{319}{}{Then let's not waste time...}
{320}{}{[More]}
{321}{}{This is crucial. Find the booster and install it on the surface. We don't have any spares.}
{322}{}{I'll handle it.}
{323}{}{The agent was ambushed by monks, but I got him out.}
{324}{}{Thank goodness. And well done. But someone still needs to install the radio gear on the surface.}
{325}{}{}
{326}{}{I'll take care of it.}
{327}{}{I found and activated the radio signal booster.}
{328}{}{Very good. Wait a moment, I need to check the signal strength...}
{329}{}{[More]}
{330}{}{Great job. What about our agent?}
{331}{}{The agent is dead.}
{332}{}{No... That's bad... Really bad. Wait a moment, I need to check the equipment...}
{333}{}{[More]}
{334}{}{Couldn't find him. Maybe he ran away?}
{335}{}{No, he didn't report back, so most likely he was captured by the cultists. Try to find out what happened to him while I deal with the equipment.}
{336}{}{Okay, I'll handle it.}
{337}{}{Nice work. Now we can eavesdrop on the fire worshippers a lot more easily. Go report to Marcos on your success.}
{338}{}{Okay. Bye, Elisa.}
