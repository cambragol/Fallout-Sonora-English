{100}{}{You see Slippery Skull.}
{101}{}{You see one of the savages of the Jackal tribe.}
{102}{}{Stay away from me.}

#Response
{200}{}{Keep your distance, stranger.}
{201}{}{Alright.}
{202}{}{Tell me about Black Fang.}
{203}{}{The best warrior of them all. Fear him, stranger. Show him respect. He brings back more food with his traps than any other. It's worth forgiving his bad temper.}
{204}{}{Tell me about the Mad Bitch.}
{205}{}{No one speaks ill of the Bitch. She leads us; everyone must show her honor and share food. But in times of famine, even giving a piece of old clothing is difficult.}
{206}{}{Who is more worthy to lead the tribe?}
{207}{}{Fang should lead us to the mountains, away from these barren lands. The Mad Bitch seeks alliances with strangers. Which is better? Let the tribe decide. I'll follow the pack.}
{208}{}{Goodbye.}
