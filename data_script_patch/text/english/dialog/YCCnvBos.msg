{100}{}{You see Roy.}
{101}{}{You see the leader of the rogue scavengers gang.}
{102}{}{Adios.}

{200}{}{Hey, stop! This is our scavenging turf. We don't need you here. Get lost.}
{1200}{}{Stop! This is our scavenging turf. We don't need you here. Get lost.}
{201}{}{Okay.}
{202}{}{Why should I listen to you?}
{203}{}{Are you looking for trouble or just not thinking straight? Use your brain a bit. This is OUR territory. Find yourself another spot and do whatever you want there. But stay out of here.}
{204}{}{Okay, fine.}
{205}{}{It *was* yours, but now it's mine. Real simple.}
{206}{}{Where do you think you're going? Have you lost your mind? Get the hell out of here!}
{1206}{}{Where do you think you're going? Have you lost your mind? Get the hell out of here!}
{207}{}{Stop! This is our... Damn, a super mutant! Everyone, we got trouble!}
{208}{}{Oh, no-no, wait...}
{209}{}{Okay. You brought this on yourself, idiot...}

{210}{}{I know what's going on here. You're operating without Old Town's permission - 'Set's Seal'. And you've enslaved the ghouls.}
{211}{}{Yeah. So what?}
{212}{}{Nothing. Just curious how that happened.}
{213}{}{You need to release the ghouls.}
{214}{}{Do you feel sorry for the ghouls? Their time has long passed. At least let them be of some use.}
{215}{}{Why do you need the ghouls?}
{216}{}{Because we aren't made of steel. Get it? We don't have any protection to work in the radioactive areas. But ghouls can work there for hours without any problem. So let them work and be of use to real people.}
{217}{}{Got it.}
{218}{}{Why haven't you got Set's Seal?}
{219}{}{The riches of the Old World belong to whoever can find them. That's fair. We have as much right to them as the ghouls do. No way we're leaving it all to them!}
{220}{}{What are you looking for here, anyway?}
{221}{}{Anything that will be useful for trade in the Hub. But the real prize here is chips. There are guys up north who will pay well for them.}
{222}{}{Now tell me what business you've got with the ghouls and our factory - or things'll get ugly.}
{223}{}{None. How about I just leave?}
{224}{}{You need to release the ghouls.}
{225}{}{What, do you feel sorry for the ghoulies? Their time has long passed. At least let them be of some use. Or are you going to work instead of them, huh?}
{226}{}{No need. I'll just take you all out.}
{227}{}{Uh, no, that's not my kind of job.}
{228}{}{Then get outta our factory!}
{229}{}{Okay.}
{230}{}{Actually, that's a great idea. What do I need to do for you to release the ghouls?}
{231}{}{Surprise, surprise! Alright, bring me 10 microchips. That'll be enough to compensate for our losses. And after that, we'll go trade up north.}
{232}{}{Okay.}
{233}{}{I've had enough of this 'fetching' crap. It'd be easier just to end you right now!}
{234}{}{I'm still waiting for the microchips. Come on, surprise me!}
{235}{}{Fuck you!}
{236}{}{I'm really trying. You'll have them soon enough.}
{237}{}{Here's one microchip.}
{238}{}{Here's }
{239}{}{ microchips.}
{240}{}{That's what we need. Just }
{241}{}{ more microchips to go. Get movin'.}
{242}{}{The last one? Heh-heh, you're quicker than those slackers. Excellent. You can have fun with your green-skinned friends. We've got nothing more to do here. We're off to chase jingling caps and Hub babes at the "Maltese Falcon"! Hey, boys, let's ride!}
{243}{}{Good riddance. No one's gonna miss you here.}
{244}{}{Goodbye.}
{245}{}{Yuck! I thought you were another ghoul. But you're just some kind of ugly mutant freak. We don't want you around here. Get lost.}

{250}{}{I've been sent by the mayor of Old Town.}
{251}{}{Yeah? And what does he want?}
{252}{}{Nothing. Just needed to see what you guys are up to here.}
{253}{}{He had some kind of proposal. But I forgot what it was. And it doesn't matter - I was planning to kill you all anyway!}
{1253}{}{He had some kind of proposal. But I forgot what it was. And it doesn't matter - I was planning to kill you all anyway!}
{254}{}{He has a proposal. He'll give you Set's Seal, and in exchange you have to quickly gather all the chips in this factory for him and release the ghouls you're forcing to work.}
{255}{}{So the chips are important for the ghoulies, huh? Ha, we've hit the jackpot! Okay, Set's Seal is a big deal if you think about it. We won't have to drag tons of stuff far, we won't be harassed, and we'll become important people in town, right? But there's one "but".}
{256}{}{What is it?}
{257}{}{This factory is one hell of a rat hole! It's full of dangers and there's high radiation in some places. And I don't understand any of this tech. That's why I make the ghouls work - they don't care about radiation and they know their way around here. So if the "big boss" wants a quick job done - someone's gonna have to go in there and handle it.}
{258}{}{Looks like I'll have to handle things as usual.}
{259}{}{Sounds good to me. You should be able to salvage at least 10 chips.}
{260}{}{I'm on it.}
{261}{}{This is stupid. I'll collect the chips and hand them over myself. You're useless. Now get the hell out of my way!}
{262}{}{The last one? Ho-ho, you're quicker than those slackers. Excellent. You can have fun with your green-skinned friends. We've got nothing more to do here. We're off to chase jingling caps and Hub booze at the "Maltese Falcon"! Hey, boys, let's ride!}
{263}{}{The last one? Ho-ho, you turned out to be quicker than those ghoul slackers. We'll take it from here. We're off to chase jingling caps and drink in Old Town. Hey, boys, let's roll!}
{264}{}{Job's done. Time to really head back to Old Town.}
{265}{}{Don't get cocky. Now the ghouls are in charge here. You'll work for them and follow their rules.}
