{100}{}{You see Paul.}
{101}{}{This man looks severely emaciated.}

{200}{}{Hey! How did you get here? You don't belong in this place. The mutants will kill you if they find you.}
{201}{}{They left you alone, didn't they? Who are you?}
{202}{}{I know. So stay quiet and don't make a sound.}

{210}{}{You're taking a big risk.}
{211}{}{If you get caught, I won't be able to help you.}
{212}{}{Why are you still here?}
{213}{}{What's up?}
{214}{}{You still have a chance to get away.}
{219}{}{See you.}

{220}{}{Who are you?}
{221}{}{The name's Paul. I keep an eye on how this platform works.}
{222}{}{Impressive. How do you know how to work this kind of tech?}
{223}{}{I don't buy it. No one these days knows how to operate old-world tech.}
{224}{}{Well, I'm an engineer, I've been trained for stuff like this my whole life.}
{225}{}{Really? Where did you get your training?}
{226}{}{You ever heard of the Brotherhood of Steel? I'm a Knight of that old order, and knowing old tech's what we do. Though my specialty's energy weapons, I had to learn the hard way to keep this platform running.}
{227}{}{I recently joined the Brotherhood myself. Glad to meet you, brother.}
{1227}{}{I recently joined the Brotherhood myself. Glad to meet you, brother.}
{228}{}{Alright, I'll take your word for it. Not like I have a choice. But only one outsider has ever been inducted into the Brotherhood, and his deeds were... well, legendary.}

{230}{}{How did you end up here?}
{231}{}{The super mutants grabbed me near Necropolis. First, they wanted to kill me, but then they found out I'm an engineer and kept me around to keep this platform running. Been a prisoner ever since.}
{232}{}{Necropolis? Where's that?}
{233}{}{It's in California. Not surprising you haven't heard of it; we're far from there.}
{234}{}{Tell me about the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{235}{}{For a long time, we kept to our bunker, but once California was at risk of mutant invasion, we had to act. Thanks to our brothers' and sisters' bravery, we broke their army, and now we're hunting down the remnants.}
{236}{}{But if you stayed in a bunker, how'd you know about the army?}
{237}{}{Honestly? One lone outsider scouted it all. Soon after, we made him an initiate. He's the one who pulled off the sabotage at their main base in Mariposa. Officially, the Brotherhood gets the credit for stopping the army. It's only fair, considering the fierce battles that followed.}
{238}{}{I hate your Brotherhood. You're all just a bunch of power-hungry invaders.}
{239}{}{You're not the first - and you won't be the last - to think that. But without us, against threats like super mutants or deathclaws, the wasteland wouldn't stand a chance. Like it or not, the Brotherhood's a necessity.}

{240}{}{Do you know where the super mutants are going?}
{241}{}{They don't even know themselves. The captain promised to find them some prosperous lands, that they'll take over to build a mutant state.}
{242}{}{Have you tried running away from here?}
{243}{}{I've already missed that chance. There's desert all around, sooner or later they'd catch me anyway. But even if I tried to make a run for it, I'd never make it back home to Lost Hills. I don't even know where we are.}
{244}{}{We are in the Sonoran Desert.}
{245}{}{Sonora, huh? Then maybe all isn't lost. There's an outpost at Rocky Point... Puerto it's called I think. They'd take me in.}
{246}{}{Then what are you waiting for?}
{247}{}{First, we need to stop the platform. There's a reactor on the lower level powering everything. If we disable it, this thing isn't going anywhere.}
{248}{}{I'll take care of it.}
{249}{}{The reactor's down.}

{250}{}{The reactor's dead. Time to get moving.}
{251}{}{As an engineer, it pains me to see tech destroyed like this. But it has to be done. The mutants won't be able to repair the platform, and out here in the desert, they're no threat to anyone.}
{252}{}{Let's go.}
{253}{}{We gotta keep it down...}
{254}{}{Let's go.}
{255}{}{You're free.}
{256}{}{I don't know how I'll get to my brothers and sisters in Rocky Point. It's time to remember everything I was taught in Lost Hills. Thank you. If I survive, I'm gonna report to the Brotherhood about your aid.}
{257}{}{Have a nice trip.}
{258}{}{Sorry, friend, but I can't let you go. The Brotherhood of Steel's evil to the core, and I'm going to kill you, just like I did your pals in Puerto Peñasco!}
{1258}{}{Sorry, friend, but I can't let you go. The Brotherhood of Steel's evil to the core, and I'm going to kill you, just like I did your pals in Puerto Peñasco!}
{259}{}{All the mutants are dead. You're free.}
{260}{}{That was impressive. This thing won't get far without mutants. And this is good. Eh, we could've used soldiers like you during the Great Mutant War.}
{261}{}{Let's leave.}
