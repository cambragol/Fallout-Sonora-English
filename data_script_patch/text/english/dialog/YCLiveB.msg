{100}{}{You see Rupert.}
{101}{}{You see a ghoul in a pre-war suit.}
{102}{}{You see a ghoul.}
{103}{}{If it weren't for De Santi, we would have reunited a long time ago.}
{104}{}{Hey, hello. You look pretty fresh for a corpse.}
{105}{}{Ugh! I can never get used to your disgusting smooth faces.}
{106}{}{Oh-h!}
{107}{}{You sure know how to ruin the fun.}

{198}{}{Hey, hello. You look pretty fresh for a corpse.}
{199}{}{I'm not a corpse.}

{200}{}{Hey, hello. Your skin looks pretty smooth for a ghoul.}
{201}{}{I'm not a ghoul.}
{202}{}{Well, then you're lucky. I'm lucky too. I keep scoring more points each time!}
{203}{}{Umm, that...}
{204}{}{Ah, if only I were always this lucky! I thought my old age would be pretty sad, but in this hotel, I feel younger than ever! And it's so much fun!}
{205}{}{Actually, I...}
{206}{}{Glad that...}
{207}{}{And now, excuse me, daddy needs a new pair of shoes. Ah, what the heck! I'm betting on red!}
{208}{}{Carry on then.}
{209}{}{Watch it, old man, gambling will ruin you.}

{220}{}{Don't mumble under your breath, my cards are hot!}
{221}{}{[Ignore him]}
{222}{}{Tell me, old man, what's your name?}
{223}{}{My name is The-Luckiest-Son-of-a-Gun-in-the-World!}
{224}{}{I'm serious.}
{225}{}{Listen, don't be such a bore. I'm not planning to be friends with you anyway. Call me old man if you want. I don't care.}
{226}{}{Alright. As you wish, old man.}
{227}{}{Your name is Rupert, isn't it?}
{228}{}{*Cough cough* I don't know who you're talking about. Never heard that name before.}
{229}{}{Maybe I should ask the receptionist? Or look in the guest book?}
{230}{}{Really? Well, then sorry for bothering you.}
{231}{}{What do you want? Who sent you?}
{232}{}{Miss Judy. She's looking for her missing husband. And it looks like he's secretly wasting all his money here.}
{233}{}{(sigh) Listen, buddy. Do you think I'd be hanging around here if I wanted to reunite with Judy?}
{234}{}{I don't really care actually. She's looking for you, that's all.}
{235}{}{So you have no interest in reuniting with your wife?}
{236}{}{You're a man, you should understand what it's like to be nagged by a woman for 80 years!}
{1236}{}{You're a woman, you can't understand what it's like to be nagged by your wife for 80 years!}
{237}{}{[Listen]}
{238}{}{I feel good here. I do what I want - drink, watch movies, play roulette! You know, Judy never let me play roulette. Never! And yet, I'd always wanted to.}
{239}{}{You know it's just a game, right?}
{240}{}{Well, yeah. But it doesn't matter - what matters is that I finally get to play it!}
{241}{}{She won't be happy if she finds out you've been hiding from her while she was looking for you.}
{242}{}{I know. Listen, tell her I'm dead, will you? It's no big deal for you, and I'll be able to live without her total supervision for a little longer.}
{243}{}{Alright. If that's what you want.}
{244}{}{You'd really do that? Oh, I'm so lucky today! So lucky!}
{245}{}{Alright, goodbye.}
{246}{}{No, you have to go find her and tell her the truth. She's your family. Hiding from her now, at the end of your lives - that's just not right.}
{247}{}{Why do you have to ruin my fun? (sigh) Alright. You're right. She'd probably find out the truth from you anyway.}
{248}{}{I won't tell her. Go and tell her yourself. She lives in San Ysidro.}

{250}{}{Just like you asked, I told her you were dead. And you know what? Her heart couldn't take it - it just gave out.}
{1250}{}{Just like you asked, I told her you were dead. And you know what? Her heart couldn't take it - it just gave out.}
{251}{}{How... it can't be... Judy... I didn't expect that... Judy... Oh... ugh...}
{252}{}{Don't tell me you're going to kick the bucket now too!}
