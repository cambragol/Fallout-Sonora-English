{100}{}{You see the Quartermaster.}
{101}{}{You see the Tinsmith in charge of the warehouse. His bald head is equipped with an advanced computing helmet.}
{102}{}{T-51b Power Armor... Intriguing how YOU managed to master such intricate equipment?}

# First dialogue
{200}{}{(not acknowledging you) Five thousand one hundred eighty-six... no, that calculation is incorrect...}
{201}{}{Hey, what are you doing?}
{202}{}{(without looking up) I manage the warehouse and trade operations. If you are not here to trade, proceed to our leader. He is located on the opposite side of the structure.}
{203}{}{I understand.}

# Re-dialogue
{210}{}{Yes?}
{211}{}{Never mind.}

{216}{}{Master Hard has integrated you into our partner system. This grants you access to discounted pricing in this warehouse.}
{217}{}{Great news.}
{218}{}{Master Hard has determined you merit a superior discount compared to standard partners. Value his discernment.}
{219}{}{So your goods are even cheaper now? This is amazing.}

{220}{}{Why do you need all this equipment?}
{221}{}{Facilitates operations. This may be complex for wastelanders to grasp.}
{222}{}{Where did you get this computer?}
{223}{}{Observe - this facility is filled with advanced technology unknown to wastelanders. We have harnessed and repurposed ancient technologies. This computer is but a minor example of our advancements.}
{224}{}{Got it.}

# About the product
{230}{}{What do you trade?}
{231}{}{Two-Sun has long been renowned for its technological prowess. Not everyone is deemed worthy of it.}
{232}{}{I see.}
{233}{}{Do you accept pre-war money for payment?}

{240}{}{No, only caps.}
{241}{}{Why?}
{242}{}{Caps are maintained by the Church of the Holy Fire in Phoenix. Although I find the cap design cumbersome, we could manufacture new coins on our equipment in the future.}
{243}{}{Caps have been upheld by the Church of the Holy Fire in Phoenix. Despite the church's fall, caps will remain a reliable currency for the foreseeable future.}
{244}{}{I see.}
{245}{}{Where do all these boxes of noodles come from?}
{246}{}{From recently discovered and opened military warehouses. They are high-quality army rations. Even we Tinsmiths occasionally tire of the monotony.}
{247}{}{Noodles make me sick to my stomach. Is there anything else?}
{248}{}{Well... no.}
{249}{}{Too bad.}
{250}{}{Actually, there is something. Don't ask about the source, but it's top-tier food. (shows three containers labeled "IRP") It will be costly.}
{251}{}{"Individual Ration Pack"? Sounds promising, I'll consider it.}
{252}{}{You'll give a discount to a member of the Brotherhood of Steel, won't you?}
{253}{}{You'll give a discount to a Follower of Fire, right?}
{254}{}{Certainly. Our allies are deserving of such courtesy.}
{255}{}{Excellent.}
{256}{}{Noodles... Isn't there anything better available?}

# If ZAX destroyed the village:
{260}{}{Holy Ohm! What are you doing here?! After the robot assault, I did not anticipate any survivors in Two-Sun. My colleagues perished, and the villagers fled. No travelers will come here now.}
{261}{}{Why don't you leave?}
{262}{}{I lack alternatives. Tinsmiths were my sole expertise. Without technology, survival is improbable. However, I plan to construct a flying machine and journey to California. I might find utility there.}
{263}{}{That's it. Well, good luck with that.}
{264}{}{How did you survive?}
{265}{}{I am familiar with these areas. Additionally, I possess equipment to evade robots. But it is merely a temporary measure.}
{266}{}{Do you still have items to trade?}

# Quest for the fusion cell
{269}{}{We have halted all energy transactions until the Flagstaff mine resumes operation. Seek fusion cells elsewhere.}
{270}{}{I need a fusion cell for a generator.}
{271}{}{This technology is too critical to distribute indiscriminately.}
{272}{}{Just name your price.}
{273}{}{After the events in the Forbidden Zone, I deserve your loyalty.}
{274}{}{Here is my price. (adds the item to the available goods) If this does not meet your expectations, you may leave.}
{275}{}{Let me think about it.}
{276}{}{Under my conditions, these items lose importance. I am ready to sell them.}
{277}{}{Good decision.}
{278}{}{For the final time, this item is not available for purchase.}
{279}{}{Come on...}

# Product Reveal
{280}{}{I've got connections all over Arizona - you'll find it's worth your while to do business with me.}
{281}{}{Maybe so. But your words alone are not enough.}
{282}{}{Shame you can't see the upside of doing business with me.}
{283}{}{Okay, that's enough. Take a look at these beautiful pieces of technology and name your price.}
{284}{}{That's more like it.}
{285}{}{Now that Master Hard is gone, there's no point in holding back your goods.}
{286}{}{With Master Hard dismantled, I have no choice but to trade with everyone. Here's all my merchandise.}
{287}{}{Smart decision.}
{288}{}{I believe I deserve access to *all* your inventory.}
{289}{}{Am I 'worthy' of your goods?}
{290}{}{No. However, Master Hard may decide otherwise.}
{291}{}{Then I should talk to him.}
{292}{}{I don't think so.}
{293}{}{Oh well.}
{294}{}{You need clients now more than ever.}
{295}{}{It's good to do business with me.}

# Upgrades
{300}{}{Can you repair my equipment?}
{301}{}{What specifically? Equipment, weapons, armor? We handle all forms of technology. However, this service requires a substantial amount of caps.}
{302}{}{Forget it.}
{303}{}{I'm talking about my personal bike.}
{304}{}{Hmm... I have not yet had the opportunity to work on such machinery. Motorcycle parts are scarce here; we primarily deal with heavy military vehicles and aircraft.}
{305}{}{[More]}
{306}{}{However, I could attempt to enhance the bike using an aircraft blower. Note that you would need to install high-performance tires and reinforce the engine to manage the increased strain.}
{307}{}{Can you do this?}
{308}{}{As I said, I lack tires and other motorcycle components. Check locations with old garages; you may find useful parts there.}
{309}{}{I see. I'll return after upgrading my motorcycle.}
{310}{}{Everything is ready. The mechanic in Garage City updated both the tires and the engine system. Tell me about that aircraft booster idea.}
{311}{}{Aircraft employ highly advanced propulsion systems, but I can adapt some components for a motorcycle. To avoid overheating, you will need efficient airflow and thermal exhaust pipes. Additional modules for the onboard computer and high-quality aviation lubricant would also be beneficial.}
{312}{}{Sounds good.}
{313}{}{Preliminary calculations suggest a 40% increase in speed. Interested? Prepare }
{314}{}{ caps, as this modification is highly labor-intensive.}
{315}{}{Here are the caps. Install that blower!}
{316}{}{I can't afford that upgrade at the moment. Looks like I'll be stuck moving at brahmin speed a while longer.}
{317}{}{I anticipated such responses. Expected behavior from wastelanders.}
{318}{}{I didn't mean to trick you...}
{319}{}{Incredible! Your bike has been transformed beyond recognition. It will now glide, rather than merely drive, on the highway!}
{320}{}{Sounds like something too complicated, expensive, and impractical. I think I can do without it.}

# Rewards
{330}{}{Master Hard mentioned a reward for me.}
{331}{}{Correct. Rewards: metal armor, laser pistol, night vision goggles. Utilize these rewards wisely.}
{332}{}{I'll put these to good use.}
{333}{}{Indeed. Here is a list of available rewards. Select and mark your choice.}
{334}{}{[Metal Armor]}
{335}{}{[Plasma Pistol]}
{336}{}{[First Aid Supplies: 3 stimpaks, 3 antidotes, 1 Rad-X]}
{337}{}{[Stealth Boy and Night Vision Goggles]}
{338}{}{[Fuel Cell Battery]}
{339}{}{[350 caps]}
{340}{}{Utilize these rewards wisely.}
{341}{}{I'll put these to good use.}

# Power Armor
{350}{}{I need repairs for my Power Armor.}
{351}{}{An exemplary piece of outdated technology. Observing this armor, I detect errors in logical circuits within my neural network. We can repair all damage, but it will require a significant number of caps.}
{352}{}{Go ahead.}
{353}{}{No need. The Brotherhood might just repair it for free.}
{354}{}{I'll think about it. Either way, I need to get out of this shell.}

# Relic
{400}{}{I have an old atomic clock. What do you have?}
{401}{}{Holy Ohm! This clock is a century old, yet it still functions.}
{402}{}{Seems to excite you.}
{403}{}{Our ancestors possessed remarkable wisdom. We salvage remnants of their technology and, with great effort, strive to replicate their swift creations. This clock represents precision technology beyond our current capabilities.}
{404}{}{I will give it to you free of charge as a gesture for future transactions. You won't refuse me service, correct?}
{405}{}{That is reasonable. You can expect more favorable prices, wasteland wanderer.}
{406}{}{Very good.}
{407}{}{I'll sell this clock for 350 caps.}
{408}{}{That is reasonable. Here are the caps. I hope this will not be our final transaction.}
{409}{}{Great.}
{410}{}{Technology for technology. I'll give you the clock if I get energy weapon specifications in return.}
{411}{}{Fair enough. I have the required information. This will certainly enhance your skills. Though, many of us disapprove of commoners tampering with advanced technology.}
{412}{}{This will be handy. See you later, Tinsmith.}
{413}{}{We have a formidable pneumatic fist used to dispense justice to those who deceive us. I do not see a clock among your belongings, desert nomad.}
{414}{}{How did this happen...}
{415}{}{Give me time to think. Don't worry, the clock won't get damaged during this time.}
{416}{}{The Quartermaster has decreased the cost of his goods by 10%.}
