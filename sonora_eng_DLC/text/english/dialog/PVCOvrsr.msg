{102}{}{Unnoticed theft is impossible under such conditions.}
{103}{}{We... can't... be stopped...}
{104}{}{}
{105}{}{Get out!}

#First dialogue
{200}{}{Impressive. You infiltrated the vault without tripping any alarms, slipped past the guards, and made it to the command center. Skills like that are exceedingly rare. Now, tell me - what brings you here?}  
{201}{}{Even with alarms blaring through the vault, you carved a path to the command center. Few could manage that. So, what exactly do you want?}  
{202}{}{A stranger wandering in a vault... always suspicious. State your business.}  
{203}{}{Aaron sent me. I want to serve the Holy Fire.}
{204}{}{I'm here for one purpose - to kill you.}
{205}{}{Then let's not waste time...}
{206}{}{Die for Villa's freedom!}
{207}{}{First tell me who I'm talking to.}
{208}{}{It seems you don't grasp the gravity of your situation. My name is Ulysses Grant - first advisor to Aaron, Lord of Phoenix. That should suffice.}  
{209}{}{You're exactly who I'm looking for. Time to finish you off.}

#First dialogue if GG is a peasant
{210}{}{I'm looking for my people from Villa. I've learned that the Followers of the Holy Fire enslaved them.}
{211}{}{Ah, Villa. Yes, I recall it now - a modest outpost clinging stubbornly to the past, far from the heart of progress. The slaves we claimed were relocated to Two-Sun, where they shall now fuel the machinery of a new era. You may see it as loss, but history will call it their highest honor.}  
{212}{}{Why do you need slaves?}
{213}{}{There are many reasons - logistical, economic, and strategic. We require labor to rebuild infrastructure, extract vital resources, and facilitate transport. Civilization advances only through diligent hands, and slavery, unpleasant as it may seem to you, remains the most expedient means of securing such labor.}  
{214}{}{Is it right to enslave innocent people?}
{215}{}{What you call innocence is mere inertia. Most of these locals waste their lives scavenging among ruins, obstructing the region's resurgence. They squabble over scraps, incapable of true cooperation. To direct their efforts toward the greater good is not a cruelty - it is a necessary recalibration of purpose.}  
{216}{}{What kind of progress are you talking about?}
{217}{}{Surely you've noticed the contrast - endless wastelands giving way, here and there, to power grids, clinics, and schools. We are the architects of that renewal. Sonora's revival has already begun under our guidance, and your Villa... well, its trivial concerns are nothing in the grand ledger of progress.}  
{218}{}{What's next - enslaving all of Sonora?}
{219}{}{Enslaving all of Sonora? How tiresome - and thoroughly inefficient. No, we aim to create thriving centers of civilization. These hubs will become models for others to emulate voluntarily, drawn by the promise of order and prosperity. Coercion is merely the lever that moves the first stone.}  
{220}{}{Villa didn't need your "model." We had food, order and happiness. We were thriving on our own.}
{221}{}{You romanticize Villa, but it stands on fragile ground. Your people face declining birthrates, genetic deformities, high mortality, and predatory neighbors. We have witnessed countless villages crumble over something as trivial as a faulty water pump. Villa's survival without external intervention is a fool's hope.}  
{222}{}{What does your cult offer?}
{223}{}{We offer nothing less than a return to civilization itself. Look at what we've achieved already - order, security, purpose. It is a revival long overdue, though it may take sacrifice to achieve it.}  
{224}{}{Nonsense. You're 'revival' has achieved nothing but create strife and slavery.}
{225}{}{I've seen it. Sonora needs a strong hand to unite its people.}
{226}{}{You lack the capacity to grasp the significance of our mission. To you, it's merely opposition - but to us, it's progress. Unfortunately, obstacles like yourself leave us no choice but to remove them... permanently.}  
{227}{}{Wait, we haven't finished...}
{228}{}{Progress demands sacrifice. Nostalgia for outdated traditions and familial loyalties must be set aside. These sentiments weigh you down like chains. Ask yourself: are you prepared to abandon them and walk forward into a brighter future, unshackled?}  
{1228}{}{Progress demands sacrifice. Nostalgia for outdated traditions and familial loyalties must be set aside. These sentiments weigh you down like chains. Ask yourself: are you prepared to abandon them and walk forward into a brighter future, unshackled?}
{229}{}{Absolutely. I want Villa to join the path of progress and civilization.}
{230}{}{I won't abandon who I am. Why should anyone have to make a sacrifice like that?}
{231}{}{Prove your intentions then - join the church of the Holy Fire. Set and be an example for your people.}
{232}{}{Become a Follower? I'll talk to Aaron then. What else can I do to help Villa?}
{233}{}{If Villa remains isolated, time and the sands will swallow it whole, as they have countless others. But if it becomes part of our growing network of colonies, it will endure. Convince your people to join with us, and I will personally see to the release of every one of your enslaved kin.}  
{234}{}{Agreed. I'll do it.}
{235}{}{You ask too much. Villa would never join with you.}
{236}{}{Talk to Aaron. He will give you further instructions.}
{237}{}{Okay.}
{238}{}{Greater good? Your destruction would serve the greater good!}
{239}{}{Villa's concerns are not trivial. They're my peoples' concerns. You're just using pretty words to hide the evil you would spread. You won't fool me.}

#First dialogue if GG became a member of the BS
{240}{}{Ah, a pleasure to meet you, brother. Reports of your service have reached my desk, and while the General Staff speaks highly of your potential, my personal agents remain unconvinced. I prefer to deal in realities, not optimistic forecasts.}  
{1240}{}{Ah, a pleasure to meet you, sister. Reports of your service have reached my desk, and while the General Staff speaks highly of your potential, my personal agents remain unconvinced. I prefer to deal in realities, not optimistic forecasts.}  
{241}{}{Brother, you've made quite an impression. Brotherhood agents speak highly of your deeds. It seems you might indeed live up to your promise.}  
{1241}{}{Sister, you've made quite an impression. Brotherhood agents speak highly of your deeds. It seems you might indeed live up to your promise.}  
{242}{}{You're a member of the Brotherhood of Steel, aren't you?}
{243}{}{Paladin Ulysses Grant. Though here, in the shadows of this forsaken land, I am known simply as the Advisor. My work requires... discretion, and this vault provides the perfect veil behind which I can operate.}  
{244}{}{What is a Brotherhood paladin doing in the heart of a strange cult?}
{245}{}{I run this... institution. The Church of the Holy Fire is no mere happenstance - it is a construct of the Brotherhood, established long ago to secure influence in Phoenix. With our guidance, we elevated a local clan to power and installed our agents at the helm. Even now, I ensure this order serves the Brotherhood's will.}  
{246}{}{So Aaron and the cultists are just Brotherhood puppets?}
{247}{}{Precisely. The Brotherhood requires resources and dominance across the region, but direct control would stretch us far too thin. The revolution and this auxiliary cult - tools of subtlety - allow us to maneuver without undue exposure. We dictate from behind the curtain, and our loyal hands carry out the necessary tasks.}  
{248}{}{Convenient. What about the cult's use of slavery?}
{249}{}{The elders may frown upon slavery, but pragmatism trumps idealism. Forced labor remains indispensable in the short term. We need generations to reshape this land, and until then, the locals must be compelled to build a future they can't yet comprehend.}  
{250}{}{What about Villa?}
{251}{}{Ah, Villa... a quaint relic of the past in the northwest. Yes, the report noted that it is your home. I sympathize with your plight, but as a member of the Brotherhood, surely you understand - your people now contribute to a purpose far greater than their insular existence.}  
{252}{}{Yes. But still, is there a way to free my Villa from bondage?}
{253}{}{There is. However, Villa must become one of our colonies - integrated fully into the Brotherhood's system. I have more pressing matters to address, so you will have to oversee this transformation. Speak with Aaron; he will provide further instructions.}  
{254}{}{Okay, I'll talk to him.}
{255}{}{Yes, but bear in mind - such integration takes time and careful planning. Villa's salvation is not an overnight endeavor.}  
{256}{}{Then let's discuss it later.}
{257}{}{Brother, the agents speak of your service with respect, though I must caution you - raising the alarm on your way here was... imprudent. Subtlety is a tool you must learn to wield if you wish to thrive.}  
{1257}{}{Sister, the agents speak of your service with respect, though I must caution you - raising the alarm on your way here was... imprudent. Subtlety is a tool you must learn to wield if you wish to thrive.}  
{258}{}{}
{259}{}{The Brotherhood informed me of your promotion. Good to see you, brother.}
{1259}{}{The Brotherhood informed me of your promotion. Good to see you, sister.}

#After the destruction of Puerto
{260}{}{Ah, I knew you would come... Savage. Even after laying waste to our base in Puerto, your thirst for revenge still burns. Such is the curse of your kind - forever shackled to grudges and bygone traditions, while the path to a brighter future lies open before you. But no... Embracing progress demands the courage to relinquish old ways and grudges. A courage you clearly lack.}  
{261}{}{In other words, the Brotherhood's mission in Sonora is a failure. Thanks to me. Deal with it, idiot.}
{262}{}{Ah, but what you call 'failure' is merely a delay. The Brotherhood is nothing if not patient. In time, the elders in California will establish a new foothold, and by then, Phoenix will be ready. This defeat is but a momentary detour. The wheels of progress continue to turn, whether you understand that or not.}  
{263}{}{Hey, why do you need those machine guns... wait, you're not going to...}
{264}{}{You're wrong. The Brotherhood failed because of its flawed ideology, not because local people held to their traditions.}
{265}{}{You dare spout such nonsense?}  
{266}{}{Not at all. You imposed ideas on people who weren't ready to accept them. That's why you faced resistance.}
{267}{}{We endeavored to educate you, elevate you, make you better! And what did we receive in return? Treachery - a knife driven into our backs! Consider all that the Brotherhood has gifted you: electricity, education, an economic foundation. Does none of this matter to you?}  
{268}{}{No, you weren't trying to make us better. You tried to make us your subjects. We were always secondary to your ideological goals, and we always will be.}
{269}{}{Perhaps. But your defiance left us with no alternatives. When gentle instruction failed, we were forced to implement our vision through... sterner measures. Progress cannot wait for the unwilling.}  
{270}{}{But who decided that your ideas about the world are correct? Just because they come from the pre-war era? You know how that ended. In war.}
{271}{}{War... war never changes. We sought to restore these lands - and its people - to the heights of their former splendor. But we inherited a world too fractured to recognize salvation when it stands before it.}  
{272}{}{You didn't inherit these lands. You invaded them.}
{273}{}{Enough! You understand nothing. Return to your hovels and cling to your ignorance. These lands are not worthy of our stewardship. Let them rot, if they will.}  
{274}{}{Hmm...}
{275}{}{Seems I can't convince you.}

#Re-dialogue
{300}{}{Report.}
{301}{}{Nothing to report yet. Well, I'll go.}
{302}{}{Can I have free access to the vault?}
{303}{}{I don't see the necessity.}  
{304}{}{Members of the Brotherhood of Steel should trust each other.}
{305}{}{As a member of the Church of the Holy Fire, I swear to my good intentions.}
{306}{}{It's difficult to complete my mission without basic support.}
{307}{}{Okay, I'll make do.}
{308}{}{Fine. Here's an access card. It grants mid-level clearance, which should be sufficient.}
{309}{}{Better than nothing.}
{310}{}{You've yet to earn that level of trust. Access denied... for now.}  
{311}{}{Thanks.}

#Questions
{320}{}{May I ask you something?}
{321}{}{What is it?}
{322}{}{I guess I'll go. By your leave, Advisor.}
{323}{}{Can I ask one more question?}
{324}{}{Can we talk about the Church of the Holy Fire?}
{325}{}{The church is a cult, yes, but it is merely a means to an end: inspiring progress and spreading knowledge.}  
{326}{}{Was this cult also created by the Brotherhood of Steel?}
{327}{}{In part. We took inspiration from a similar group in California. The concept proved effective.}  
{328}{}{What kind of vault is this?}
{329}{}{Before the Great War, similar vaults were built across the United States to protect the population from nuclear strikes and their aftermath. This one is Vault 25.}
{330}{}{What do you know about the Great War?}
{331}{}{The same old story - nations consumed by greed for resources and power. But this time, the fallout erased almost everything.}  
{332}{}{How do you feel about Aaron?}
{333}{}{I'm not discussing him with you.}
{334}{}{He's a puppet. Ambitious, yes, but intellectually lacking. Precisely the kind of tool we require.}  
{335}{}{Someday he might resist his position.}
{336}{}{He won't. Without our support, he's powerless - and he knows it.}  
{337}{}{I have another question.}
{338}{}{Why do you need a nuclear bomb?}
{339}{}{I'm not discussing that with you.}
{340}{}{The Brotherhood has sound reasons for retaining such weapons, particularly after California's recent events. Not that it would mean anything to you.}  
{341}{}{Can we talk about the Brotherhood of Steel?}
{342}{}{The Brotherhood of Steel is superior to the locals in every way... except numbers.}
{343}{}{How did the Brotherhood end up running a cult?}
{344}{}{The Brotherhood needs control over the surrounding lands, which we can't maintain directly. So, we established a puppet government in Phoenix to manage the region. We created this cult and led a revolution under its banner.}
{345}{}{What are the Brotherhood's plans for this region?}
{346}{}{We are collecting pre-war technology and resources. Our headquarters in California needs nuclear fuel, which requires workers. Establishing, strengthening, and expanding our power in Arizona is our immediate task.}

{350}{}{I'll be in Phoenix for a while. Are there any tasks for me in the city?}
{351}{}{No. Go to Puerto; nothing else takes precedence.}  
{352}{}{The task is clear.}
{353}{}{Actually, yes. One matter requires attention. George Crook has become a liability since his return to Phoenix. The old fool talks too much and asks for too much. He must be... dealt with.}  
{354}{}{What's the catch?}
{355}{}{Aaron and Crook have a long-standing friendship. It's imperative that Aaron remains unaware of who ordered this. Unfortunately, Crook seldom leaves the casino, complicating the task.}  
{356}{}{How can I remain unnoticed then?}
{357}{}{That's your concern. I'll reward you with 500 caps for eliminating him.}  
{358}{}{Okay. I'll handle it and report back.}
{359}{}{Too risky. I'll focus on the holodisk.}
{360}{}{Commander Crook had a "accident."}
{361}{}{I've already heard the rumors. Well done.}
{362}{}{Glad to be of service.}
{1362}{}{Glad to be of service.}
{363}{}{Here's your payment. And remember - keep this arrangement to yourself. Not that anyone would believe you.}  
{364}{}{Just one question - why kill Crook? Didn't he serve the glory of the empire?}
{365}{}{Understood, sir. May I go?}
{1365}{}{Understood, sir. May I go?}
{366}{}{There are two reasons. Firstly, Crook has outlived his usefulness. His kind becomes a burden when there are no more wars to fight. Restless old soldiers often cause more harm than good.}
{367}{}{And the second reason?}
{368}{}{Aaron needed a reminder. His recent successes have inflated his ego. Eliminating Crook will bring him back in line - subtly, of course.}  
{369}{}{I see.}
{370}{}{This changes nothing for you. Your mission is in Puerto. Get going.}  
{371}{}{Got it.}

#Your quest
{400}{}{You've successfully manipulated Aaron and wormed your way into his trust, but don't assume you can play the same game with me. After everything that transpired in Villa, I would hope your ambitions have matured accordingly.}  
{401}{}{Wha... How do you...}
{402}{}{I know every move that takes place in this city. My reach extends farther than you realize - eyes and ears report directly to me. Naturally, the situation in Villa did not escape my notice. Now, tell me - what exactly do you hope to accomplish with these intrigues of yours?}  
{403}{}{I only want freedom for my people.}
{404}{}{Ah, a noble pursuit - albeit an ill-conceived one. Freedom is not as simple as you imagine. As the Ancients understood, freedom demands a cost - one many are unwilling to pay. Your people cannot thrive, nor safeguard this so-called freedom, if they stubbornly isolate themselves from the larger world. Progress is your only option. If your community wishes to survive, it must adapt.}  
{405}{}{So... become a colony?}
{406}{}{After such a long journey, I realize now that Villa must change.}
{407}{}{Precisely. If your people are to endure, they must become one of our colonies. It is the only realistic path forward.}  
{408}{}{A colony?}
{409}{}{Yes, a colony - an arrangement of mutual benefit. While your village would surrender some of its autonomy, it would gain access to knowledge, technology, and advanced resources. But progress comes with a price - your customs and traditions will need to evolve. It will fall to you to convince your people that they must abandon these outdated practices and embrace a new way of life.}  
{410}{}{This won't be easy. But I'll do what it takes. They'll listen to me.}
{411}{}{Good. Then your next step is a brief but hazardous one. Take this holodisk - encrypted with vital information - and deliver it to the military base at Steel Port. Traveling with caravans will offer the safest route.}  
{412}{}{What about my enslaved kinsmen?}
{413}{}{Their safety will be seen to. I will issue orders ensuring they are properly managed. However, the question of colonization will require final approval from headquarters. Go to Puerto Peñasco and present my report to the commander-in-chief.}  
{414}{}{I'm leaving now.}
{415}{}{I've completed Aaron's quests. Now I ask that the peasants of Villa be freed.}
{1415}{}{I've completed Aaron's quests. Now I ask that the peasants of Villa be freed.}
{416}{}{Your efforts have undoubtedly impressed men like Aaron. But I am curious - what is it you truly desire for your people?}  
{417}{}{What kind of base is this that I have to take the holodisk to?}
{418}{}{The base lies at Puerto Peñasco, on the Gulf of California. Few outside the Brotherhood even know of its existence. All will become clearer once you arrive.}  
{419}{}{I see. Can I ask other questions?}
{420}{}{I'll head there immediately.}
{421}{}{I could use a bit more explanation... But, I'll head there now.}
{422}{}{What's on the holodisk?}
{423}{}{It contains a confidential report bound for headquarters - some of which pertains to Villa. Do not attempt to read it or show it to anyone else. It is encrypted and far beyond your comprehension.}  
{424}{}{Looks like you've seen through my plan. Time to finish you off!}
{425}{}{Enough! Give up our customs? Our traditions? That's what makes us who we are! This will never work. You're pushing too far, demanding too much.}
{426}{}{How disappointingly provincial... It seems you lack the vision to be of any real use to us.}  
{1426}{}{How disappointingly provincial... It seems you lack the vision to be of any real use to us.}  
{427}{}{Hey, is that a gun?}
