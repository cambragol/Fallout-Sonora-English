{100}{}{You see the Ranger General.}
{101}{}{You see a strong, gray-haired old man who has seen life in all its harsh realities.}
{102}{}{I'm used to talking to real people, not robots. Understand?}
{103}{}{Goodbye, Ranger. Your ideals proved... unviable.}
{104}{}{Sorry, but this lady needs to cool down a bit.}
{105}{}{Glad to see you in good health. But I have no time to talk now -- the evil sown by the Brotherhood still festers in the wastelands.}

#First Dialogue
{200}{}{I've been informed that a certain peasant was insisting on meeting with me over an important matter. Usually, scouts and envoys handle external contacts. So, I hope this is truly something important?}
{1200}{}{I've been informed that a certain peasant woman was insisting on meeting with me over an important matter. Usually, scouts and envoys handle external contacts. So, I hope this is truly something important?}
{201}{}{[Continue]}
{202}{}{So, why are you here?}
{203}{}{You know, now I realize I have no business being here. This was a mistake. I'll leave, and you'll forget about me.}
{204}{}{Is this some kind of absurd joke?}
{205}{}{I'm serious. Sorry for the bother.}
{206}{}{You know, I have a lot of questions for you.}

#Re-dialogue
{210}{}{I'm listening.}
{211}{}{Goodbye.}
{212}{}{My god, judging by your appearance, you've had your fair share of the merciless Wasteland. I'm truly sorry.}
{213}{}{Thank you, General, for your kind words. Most people would just send me away.}
{214}{}{I don't need pity. Look at you, old man.}
{215}{}{Report, Ranger.}

#Family of a criminal
{220}{}{There's an angry woman demanding to see you.}
{221}{}{Yes, I was informed. I have endless sympathy for such people, but nothing can be done now. Families of criminals have always been branded, even in the Old World.}
{222}{}{There must be a way to handle this.}
{223}{}{My intervention won't change anything. This woman will always hate the Rangers, no matter how much good we do for her. And in neighboring settlements, the locals won't give her any peace if they learn about her husband's dark past.}
{224}{}{Go on.}
{225}{}{You make an interesting point.}
{226}{}{I'm afraid the only way out for this family is to leave Sonora and head east to California, where they can start anew.}
{227}{}{I'll try to get this idea across to her.}
{228}{}{Maybe not the worst idea.}

#Lone Ranger in Flagstaff
{230}{}{What is Ranger Kuyuk doing in Flagstaff?}
{231}{}{(sighs) Our walking nuisance with a rifle. Headquarters was against sabotage in Flagstaff, but one ranger's personal grudge turned out to be more important than the regulations. It's hard to blame him for that.}
{232}{}{Are you making excuses for him?}
{233}{}{Kuyuk suffered a lot after the enslavement of his village. Apparently, he found a way to get even for his past in Flagstaff. We let him go so he could make sense of his life and find peace of mind.}
{234}{}{So, are you planning to pull him out of there?}
{235}{}{Demoralizing one of our best marksmen? There'd have to be a damn good reason for that.}
{236}{}{I think you're right, General. You shouldn't drag him out of there until he wants to go.}
{237}{}{I can't believe my ears! This is what a general says? That's it, I'm outta here.}
{238}{}{He's targetting everyone. His actions harm ordinary, peaceful colonists.}
{239}{}{I don't care about his problems. Just get him out of there.}
{240}{}{This changes things. Looks like things have gone too far.}
{241}{}{You're his general. He won't disobey your orders if you give them.}
{242}{}{Most likely. I want you to pass on my order to return to base if you find him again. He maintains radio silence and for some reason avoids the other Rangers.}
{243}{}{Will do!}
{244}{}{If I'm in the area.}

#Union Villas
{250}{}{Things are hard in my home village. We need the Rangers' help.}
{251}{}{Hard times... This could be said about almost any settlement in Arizona and California. But unlike ordinary residents, we actually have the opportunity to fight for the rights of people in the wasteland.}
{252}{}{[More]}
{253}{}{Maintaining order requires serious investment in Ranger training, squad and patrol equipment, reconnaissance, and combat operations. We can't invest resources into every issue, unless there is some return for our efforts.}
{254}{}{I think Villa would be able to supply you with food at the least.}
{255}{}{You know, we really have nothing to offer. Looks like coming to you was pointless.}
{256}{}{So basically you charge something for your protection?}
{257}{}{Of course. This is a kind of security tax - a normal practice in the Old World.}
{258}{}{What if the population has nothing to pay taxes with?}
{259}{}{We know how to benefit from any cooperation. Some can build houses, others can grow crops, and still others make good cadets. With the right approach, a use can be found for anyone.}

{260}{}{Villa... The Rangers always respected your independence. You kept to yourselves, stayed out of everyone's business. But when we were starving, you shut your doors and turned us away. And now you come asking for help? So, tell me - who sent you to us?}
{261}{}{The village Council - they've decided that it is time to form an alliance with you.}
{262}{}{Nobody. Many of Villa's people were enslaved and taken to Flagstaff.}
{263}{}{Nobody. Many of Villa's people were enslaved and taken into the wastelands.}
{264}{}{I'm here on my own.}

{270}{}{I see... We've long sought an alliance with Villa... perhaps now is the time, as we need food now more than ever. And *you* need us. But I'm concerned your kin's pride might cause friction with our troops.}
{271}{}{That's probably true. Still, will you help us?}
{272}{}{I don't give a damn about *friction*. My only concern is saving Villa.}
{273}{}{Unfortunately, I'm afraid this isn't the best time. We're facing big problems in the southeast, and we've committed all our forces in that direction.}
{274}{}{Maybe I could help with some of these problems. Problem solving is my little hobby, General.}
{275}{}{Hmm... Talk to Commander Helford. Provided you help us, he might be able to spare a few people for garrison duty in Villa. Then we can discuss the terms of an alliance... if your community truly wants it.}
{276}{}{Thanks, General. I'll talk to Helford.}
{277}{}{Not so fast. Remember, you'll need to act as our envoy to your people. Convince them of our goodwill and the necessity of this alliance.}
{278}{}{Got it.}
{279}{}{You promised to help. Some of Villa's folks are still enslaved.}

{280}{}{Commander Helford agreed to protect Villa.}
{281}{}{(nods thoughtfully, lost in thought for a moment) Times are changing...}
{282}{}{Uh, what?}
{283}{}{[Listen]}
{284}{}{Villa's folks used to shun outsiders and chase away the Rangers. But times are changing, and so are you, whether you like it or not. I think it's time we put aside old grudges.}
{285}{}{You think we can form an alliance now?}
{286}{}{Maybe. I'll instruct Commander Helford to gather a detachment for your Villa. Discuss the details with him. Remember, you'll need to be our voice among your people. Once your community is ready, we'll seal the alliance officially.}
{287}{}{Thanks, General.}
{288}{}{Some of our people are still enslaved in another city.}
{289}{}{You mean the Flagstaff mine? We're aware of that whole situation and have been working on it. We'll try to buy back some of your folks from that hellhole. Your fellow villagers will be home soon.}
{290}{}{How do you know so much about us?}
{291}{}{We gather intel on every settlement in the wasteland. It's part of our job. Plus, your leader once came to us... What was his name? Ander... no, Andres Tejada.}
{292}{}{That's my father! I didn't know he ventured so far from Villa.}
{1292}{}{That's my father! I had no idea he traveled this far.}
{293}{}{Yes. Unfortunately, those talks led nowhere.}

{294}{}{Villa is ready for an alliance.}
{295}{}{Excellent. From this day on, consider our union official. Return to Villa and celebrate with your people.}
{296}{}{Will do.}
{297}{}{Finish your mission first. Then we'll talk.}
{298}{}{Alright.}

#Jackals
{300}{}{Let's talk about the Jackals.}
{301}{}{The Jackals are a thorn in the side of this land. What exactly do you want to discuss?}
{302}{}{I know the location of their main base. And I managed to scout the inside a bit as well.}
{303}{}{A bold claim. No one's ever found that place and lived to tell the tale.}
{304}{}{What about the ranger I helped?}
{305}{}{So that was your doing? Well, Ranger Jason's inexperience showed - he got lost on the way back and wandered the desert until he stumbled upon one of our abandoned outposts. We never got the exact coordinates of the Jackals base from him, and searching the whole area for their hideout was too much.}
{306}{}{Well, I guess he had to put his own survival first...}
{307}{}{Trust me, I've got your only lead.}
{308}{}{Indeed. So, where is this base?}
{309}{}{On the border of the Mojave and Sonora deserts, north-east of the Villa.}
{310}{}{I need to check my maps. Wait a moment.}
{311}{}{Yes, that lines up with what we know. We'll have to conduct a recon mission there. And if we find the base... we'll wipe it out.}
{312}{}{Great plan. Those Jackals are cannibal savages that deserve to die. Wipe them all out!}
{313}{}{Good. We'll need a guide for this operation. Your participation will allow you to claim trophies. Will you help?}
{1313}{}{Good. We'll need a guide for this operation. Your participation will allow you to claim trophies. Will you help?}
{314}{}{Yes.}
{315}{}{No.}
{316}{}{So I'll have to... kill?}
{317}{}{I like your attitude. A strike team will be waiting at the location you indicated. Head there immediately.}
{1317}{}{I like your attitude. A strike team will be waiting at the location you indicated. Head there immediately.}
{318}{}{The journey isn't easy. Can you make it easier for me?}
{319}{}{Will do, General!}
{320}{}{Talk to the patrols. They'll take you with them.}
{321}{}{Sad to hear. Well, as usual, we'll handle it ourselves. Thanks for the information, you can go.}
{322}{}{I've changed my mind! Let me join the assault.}
{323}{}{Goodbye.}
{324}{}{You can just stand and watch... Watch as your saviors and protectors are killed. Or you can take up arms and help them. So, will you help?}
{1324}{}{You can just stand and watch... Watch as your saviors and protectors are killed. Or you can take up arms and help them. So, will you help?}
{325}{}{Well, you know best what to do next.}
{326}{}{Alright. We'll handle the rest ourselves. Thanks for the information.}
{327}{}{Glad I could help.}
{1327}{}{Glad I could help.}

{330}{}{Don't be so hasty. The Jackals could be turned into allies if they had reliable food supplies.}
{331}{}{What are you talking about? These savages have bled the Rangers and surrounding settlements dry. There's no negotiating with them!}
{332}{}{I think it's worth a shot. They're aggressive because they're starving.}
{333}{}{Hmm. Then, tell me, what's the advantage of allying with cannibalistic savages?}
{334}{}{They're scattered across the wasteland. Destroying the main base will only anger the remaining clans. It could become a war that drags on for years.}
{335}{}{The thought of war with savages isn't frightening, just irritating. Fine, let's try diplomacy. Maybe it'll unite and pacify the Jackal clans. Thanks for the intel.}
{336}{}{Glad to help, General. I'll return to the Jackals and prep them for negotiations.}
{1336}{}{Glad to help, General. I'll return to the Jackals and prep them for negotiations.}
{337}{}{Yeah, last time they tried to kill and eat me. I'd rather not negotiate with them again.}
{338}{}{Nothing I guess. They're just... beasts. Annihilate them!}

{340}{}{I wish to report Ranger Garth's crimes.}
{341}{}{The Ranger at the Aqueduct? We stationed him there to maintain order... What crimes has he committed?}
{342}{}{He's murdered numerous people, travellers and refugees, and dumped their bodies into the aqueduct tunnels.}
{343}{}{Can you prove this? (tired sigh) We'll have a big trial ahead... Alright, we'll take Garth into custody. Thanks for the intel... though this news weighs heavily on me, especially in such hard times.}
{344}{}{Yes, I understand... Goodbye, General.}

#Ranger Title
{350}{}{I want to join the Rangers.}
{351}{}{Commendable zeal. But the title of Ranger must be earned. Many cadets spend years training and carrying out missions to earn their badge. What merits or accomplishments do you bring to the table?}
{352}{}{I don't think I have much to show for it.}
{353}{}{As I suspected. Join the cadet corps and serve a few years in our ranks.}
{354}{}{I'll think about it.}
{355}{}{Mind if I take a bit more of your time, General?}
{356}{}{Is there a quicker way?}
{357}{}{Hmm. Speak with Commander Helford. He's been on the lookout for recruits for special assignments.}
{358}{}{Alright, I might do that.}
{359}{}{A bold statement, but not enough for a Ranger's rank.}
{360}{}{I wiped out the Jackal tribe.}
{1360}{}{I eradicated the Jackal tribe.}
{361}{}{I helped forge an alliance with the Jackals.}
{362}{}{Thanks to me, the slave trade in Flagstaff is no more.}
{363}{}{I freed the slaves in Flagstaff.}
{1363}{}{I liberated the slaves in Flagstaff.}
{364}{}{I resolved the conflict in San Brahmin in favor of the Rangers.}
{365}{}{I brought down the Cathedral of Fire in Phoenix.}
{1365}{}{I destroyed the Cathedral of Fire in Phoenix.}
{366}{}{I took down the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{1366}{}{I dismantled the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{367}{}{I halted the Tinsmiths' expansion.}
{368}{}{With my help, the Liberation Party toppled Aaron.}
{369}{}{[CHEAT: I deserve this title, General.]}
{370}{}{This list is impressive. Let me check the report on your activities... Yes, our intel is tracking a few "remarkable" individuals. Don't worry, it's routine procedure.}
{371}{}{Hmm. Alright...}
{372}{}{Your reputation in the wasteland doesn't quite match your deeds. Many see you as less than trustworthy.}
{373}{}{You know how it goes. You can't please everyone.}
{374}{}{Do the Rangers heed the words of wastelanders? Don't make me laugh.}
{375}{}{Some rangers don't have the best opinion of you. Not a major offense, but I must heed the words of my troops.}
{376}{}{In time, they'll come around.}
{377}{}{I've got my issues with some rangers too. But I don't come running to the General.}
{378}{}{There are rumors of your ties with highwaymen. Sometimes it's best to steer clear of troublemakers.}
{379}{}{They're not troublemakers, believe me, General.}
{380}{}{Who's the bad guy here? Me? I'm not spreading rumors. Let them say it to my face.}
{381}{}{They say you're part of the Followers of Fire. Not exactly a glowing endorsement.}
{382}{}{The Rangers could use someone on the inside of that 'church'.}
{383}{}{It's unfortunate you disagree with our faith. You should repent before the Holy Fire.}
{384}{}{It says here you're involved with an organization called the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{385}{}{That's right. At the time, it seemed like a good idea. Not anymore.}
{386}{}{Indeed. The Rangers should regard this "organization" with due respect.}
{387}{}{Despite your accomplishments, I can't accept you into our ranks. You need to earn more trust.}
{388}{}{No problem, General. My confidence remains unshaken.}
{389}{}{Gee, after this, I don't know if I even want to become a ranger.}
{390}{}{Hmm. These are exceptional accomplishments. Only a few have earned their badge without years of hard training. But I'm willing to initiate you into the Rangers.}
{391}{}{So, can I get my Ranger badge?}
{392}{}{That's par for the course. I always get what I aim for.}
{393}{}{Are you ready to bear this burden? Then, swear to uphold Law and Order and to honor the Rangers.}
{1393}{}{Are you ready to bear this burden? Then, swear to uphold Law and Order and to honor the Rangers.}
{394}{}{I swear to uphold Law and Order, and to honor the Rangers!}
{395}{}{Excellent. Wear your badge with pride. Speak to the quartermaster for your initial gear. I'll prepare the paperwork for your enrollment.}
{396}{}{Thank you, General!}

#Questions
{400}{}{May I ask you a few questions?}
{401}{}{Make it quick. I've little time for idle chatter.}
{402}{}{You're right, enough talk.}
{403}{}{Just one more question.}

{410}{}{How did you become a Ranger?}
{411}{}{I passed all the milestones and rose to the rank of General through honest effort.}
{412}{}{You must've traveled a lot?}
{413}{}{Indeed, I've been to many parts of the Southwest, including the Angel's Boneyard, Las Vegas, and Phoenix. The same problems everywhere -- hunger, devastation, and endless wasteland.}

{420}{}{Can you tell me about this place?}
{421}{}{This is the main Ranger base in Arizona. The power plant is our citadel, the dam our fortress. Outside, you'll find the info center and training area.}
{422}{}{Are there other bases?}
{423}{}{Yes. There are several large bases like this in Nevada and California. We maintain connections, but each has its own rules and missions.}
{424}{}{What is the Rangers' mission?}
{425}{}{We bring Law and Order to this chaotic world. We start by protecting settlements and caravan routes from raiders and mutants. But that's just the beginning.}
{426}{}{[More]}
{427}{}{Settlements who ally with us must accept the Law, pay taxes, and contribute through useful work like farming or hunting.}
{428}{}{Why did you dam the Colorado?}
{429}{}{(sighs mockingly) The dam's been here a long time. It uses water flow to generate electricity... I assume you know what that is. We just repaired it and turned it into a fort to guard against enemies and the elements.}
{430}{}{But your checkpoints and fort block the only crossing of the Colorado for miles.}
{431}{}{The checkpoints keep the dam and power plant secure from sabotage or accidents. This equipment is vital, not just for us but for the surrounding areas too. There's a ferry downstream with reasonable prices for crossing.}
{432}{}{What Law are you talking about, General?}
{433}{}{Simple rules for a prosperous society. Don't kill unless necessary. Don't take what's not yours. Act for the good of your community. These are the basics. Unfortunately, many in the Wasteland can't read, so we have to explain it directly.}
{434}{}{The bonds of community are far more important than laws.}
{435}{}{(tired sigh) As they said in the Old World, the law is harsh, but it's the law. People couldn't devise anything better for self-organization and discipline. Rejecting the Law leads to chaos, and we've learned this well over the past hundred years.}
{436}{}{The Old World... it's been in ruins for ages.}
{437}{}{Correct. The Nuclear Apocalypse was a result of arrogance and folly. Now we're paying the price. But everyone makes mistakes. The key is what lessons we learn from them.}
{438}{}{The chief has not sided with the missionares, despite growing pressure. I'll head back and help him make the right choice.}

#Holodisk of Ulysses Grant
{450}{}{You might be interested in the report on this holodisk. It's from the Cathedral.}
{451}{}{From the Cathedral of the Holy Fire in Phoenix? Intriguing. Where did you get this holodisk?}
{452}{}{I managed to win over the 'Advisor'. He tasked me with delivering this report to the military base in Puerto Penasco.}
{453}{}{This info is a bit dated, nevertheless, thank you for your help.}
{454}{}{You're welcome.}
{455}{}{Well, well. Quite interesting. We've been watching this base for some time and knew the Cathedral was involved. This secret report sheds some light... Why are you giving it to us?}
{456}{}{Let's just say I'm... disillusioned with the ideals of the Holy Fire.}
{1456}{}{Let's just say I'm... disappointed in the tenets of the Holy Fire.}
{457}{}{I have a personal vendetta against this Council. They supported the slavers who captured my family.}
{458}{}{I can understand such a sentiment. Thank you for your help; this intel could prove very valuable.}
{459}{}{You're welcome.}

#San Brahmin - Quest
{460}{}{I just hope this alliance isn't coming too late. Times are hard, and we'll need all the help we can get. But until your community gets back on its feet and brings in a new harvest, things could still change.}  
{461}{}{What do you mean?}
{462}{}{The slave trade has reached your quiet, isolated community. But the real threat behind it casts a shadow over all of Southern Arizona. We're fighting even now to keep San Brahmin safe from it.}  
{463}{}{We didn't want to get involved in a war.}
{464}{}{No matter how much you try to stay hidden, the world already knows about Villa. If San Brahmin falls, your quiet community could be next.}  
{465}{}{Damn, something needs to be done.}
{466}{}{Indeed. On that note, I need you to do something. Bring me a report from Ranger Oscar in San Brahmin - he's working with the locals there. Think of it as part of our deal.}  
{467}{}{Alright. Seems straightforward. Permission to go, General?}
{468}{}{Looks like I'll have to handle this before the threat reaches Villa. See you, General.}
{469}{}{I'm all ears. What's the latest news from San Brahmin?}

{470}{}{I need to talk about the situation in San Brahmin.}
{471}{}{I actually haven't spoken with ranger Oscar yet regarding the situation there.}
{472}{}{Then hurry. The more we delay, the stronger our enemy becomes.}
{473}{}{Understood, General.}
{474}{}{[CHEAT: It's done!]}
{475}{}{So, the missionaries have left San Brahmin, which is good news. But we can't forget they might come back. We also missed the opportunity to form a solid alliance with the tribal leader. That moment has passed.}  
{476}{}{[More]}  
{477}{}{Undoubtably though, the missionaries in San Brahmin acted under orders from Phoenix. It seems 'lord' Aaron's dreams of an empire are closer to reality than we thought.}  
{478}{}{How can we stop this 'lord' Aaron?}  
{479}{}{It won't be easy. But there's a rebel group in Phoenix also fighting against Aaron and his church. Try reaching out to them and offering our help. Rangers don't do well in heavily populated areas - that's why I'm asking you.}  
{480}{}{What's your interest in San Brahmin again?}  
{481}{}{We've had to intervene in several local conflicts to contain the spread of Phoenix's 'Empire.' The situation is critical and demands urgent action.}  
{482}{}{[More]}  
{483}{}{Head to San Brahmin and find Ranger Oscar. He's organizing the locals to resist the invaders. Help him if he needs it, and report back to me.}  
{484}{}{Understood, General.}
{1484}{}{Understood, General.}
{485}{}{Looks like I'm getting dragged into your war. Hope it's worth it.}
{486}{}{Just get a report from Oscar? Sounds simple enough.}
{487}{}{Ranger Oscar fell in battle, defending the tribe's freedom.}  
{488}{}{It's sad news, but he knew the risks. We'll remember Oscar as a hero.}  
{489}{}{I'm really sorry.}  
{490}{}{Ranger Oscar abandoned San Brahmin. Things aren't looking good over there.}  
{491}{}{I don't blame him. I'm sure Oscar did all he could.}  
{492}{}{I believe he tried his best.}  
{493}{}{Ranger Oscar completed his mission in San Brahmin, and the situation there has shifted considerably.}  
{494}{}{I haven't gotten the full report yet, but I'm sure you both have plenty to share.}  
{495}{}{Of course.}
{496}{}{So how did it all end in San Brahmin? I'm waiting for the full report...}
{497}{}{[Report]}
{498}{}{Excellent work. Together, we've secured the tribe's freedom. This victory will remind everyone of the Rangers' worth - and we've got a fresh supply of brahmin meat to show for it.}  
{499}{}{[Next]}

#Phoenix - Quest Conclusion
{500}{}{I need to talk to you about Phoenix.}
{501}{}{You have my attention. What news do you have?}
{502}{}{Unfortunately, it's still the same.}
{503}{}{How can I find those rebels mentioned earlier?}
{504}{}{As far as I know, they're hiding in the underground sewers and using encrypted radio transmissions. You might also ask around; I'm sure some locals support them. But be careful with your inquiries.}
{505}{}{Thank you, this might help.}
{506}{}{Why is it so important to get rid of Aaron and his church?}
{507}{}{The cult is nothing more than a puppet in Aaron's hands, the de facto 'lord' of Phoenix. He's set on building an empire, conquering territory, and silencing any opposition by force.}  
{508}{}{[Next]}
{509}{}{Then I need to find those rebels quickly. How do I do that?}
{510}{}{But why is it so important to get rid of the Church of the Holy Fire?}
{511}{}{The Cathedral of Fire in Phoenix has been destroyed.}
{512}{}{(sigh of relief) Excellent work! At least that's one less enemy to worry about.}
{513}{}{[More]}
{514}{}{Taking such drastic measures was the right call. Who knows what secrets were locked away in that temple or the havoc they might have unleashed on our fragile world.}
{1514}{}{Taking such drastic measures was the right call. Who knows what secrets were locked away in that temple or the havoc they might have unleashed on our fragile world.}
{515}{}{[More]}
{516}{}{But a tougher challenge lies ahead. While you rest, I need to gather the field commanders. Meet me in the briefing room; you need to be there too.}
{517}{}{I'll be there, General.}
{518}{}{Aaron, the Lord of Phoenix, is dead.}
{519}{}{(sigh of relief) I heard the news. Outstanding job. One less tyrant to worry about.}
{520}{}{[More]}
{521}{}{Without its leader, the city will fall into chaos. Aaron's lieutenants will turn on each other for power, civilians will revive old grudges against the church, and the rebels will have a chance to act more openly and decisively. It'll be a tough period, but in the end, it'll pave the way for a better future for Phoenix.}  
{522}{}{[More]}
{523}{}{Aaron is behind the resurgence of slavery, the spread of dangerous pre-war tech, and the rise of drug use across Arizona. Our world is too fragile to let tyrants like him thrive.}  
{524}{}{Agreed.}
{525}{}{What a coincidence - I just came from there!}
{526}{}{The Liberation Party, led by Marcos, stormed the cathedral. The Lord of Phoenix is dead.}

{550}{}{I'm not going to trust a snake. Prove you can be trusted, then we'll talk. You know the way out.}
{551}{}{Alright, General Mossman, I get it.}
{552}{}{You're making a big mistake, General. You'll regret this.}
{553}{}{So, you're here to bring justice? I think you're here for your own selfish reasons.}
{554}{}{Why was I stripped of my rank?}
{555}{}{You can't fight on two fronts without losing loyalty somewhere along the way. Conflict is inevitable. If you side with the imperialists who are tightening their grip on Southern Arizona, then you have no place with the Rangers.}
{556}{}{The divide between faith and law runs too deep. There's no understanding in a situation like that - only conflict. If you follow the cult's path, you don't belong with the Rangers.}
{557}{}{Your actions show a clear break from the principles of law and order. Whether you misunderstood them or not, the responsibility is still yours. We can't allow someone like you to wear the Ranger badge.}
{558}{}{[More]}
{559}{}{Leave in peace. Out of respect for your past service, we're just stripping you of your title. In other circumstances, treason might warrant execution.}
{560}{}{I understand, General. You won't hear from me again.}
{561}{}{Learn to keep an open mind, General. You'll need it someday.}  
{562}{}{We know what you're up to. Leave. The sentry will escort you out.}
{563}{}{[Leave room]}

{570}{}{A very unexpected visit. I thought your church despised the Rangers.}
{571}{}{Can't we live in peace?}
{572}{}{Only if we build barricades and a moat filled with radioactive waste at the border.}
{573}{}{[More]}
{574}{}{Your church imposes its twisted dogmas on others and punishes those who disagree. Your leader, under the church's banner, creates an empire and revives slavery. We have nothing to negotiate with a snake. Go deliver this message to your 'lord'. These negotiations are over.}
{575}{}{[Leave room]}
{576}{}{So, here comes a goodwill ambassador from the Brotherhood of Steel itself. Are you here to present an armistice? Or perhaps a demand for surrender?}
{577}{}{I don't know what you're talking about. I'm here on my own.}
{578}{}{Maybe. Either way, we can't let you stay in our base. The sentry will show you out.}
{579}{}{[Leave room]}
{580}{}{If you fail to negotiate with the Brotherhood, your dam will be obliterated.}
{581}{}{Threats like these only prove the Brotherhood of Steel's true nature. Your 'brotherhood' was built for war, not for building a better world. It's time you learned how to coexist with others. Now go, and take this message to your general. These talks are finished.}  
{582}{}{[Leave]}

#Phoenix - Completing the Quest
{590}{}{Is everyone here? Let's get started then.}
{591}{}{[More]}
{592}{}{As you know, our new ally, }
{1592}{}{As you know, our new ally, }
{593}{}{ from Villa, liberated the wasteland from the tyrant Aaron. Reports are streaming in from across the wasteland about the collapse of his cult. Soon, this fight will be just a memory.}
{1593}{}{ from Villa, liberated the wasteland from the tyrant Aaron. Reports are streaming in from across the wasteland about the collapse of his cult. Soon, this fight will be just a memory.}
{594}{}{[More]}
{595}{}{But this isn't the end. As we suspected, Aaron was just a pawn in a much bigger game. The Tinsmiths supplied him with weapons and gear in exchange for cheap uranium.}
{596}{}{[More]}
{597}{}{The real twist? A shadowy third party brokered the deal. Without them, Aaron and the Tinsmiths would've never joined forces, and Aaron wouldn't have grabbed power.}  
{598}{}{[More]}
{599}{}{We know almost nothing about this group, except they're operating out of the old port of Puerto Penasco and have an aggressive military footprint there.}
{600}{}{[More]}
{601}{}{We do know this: raw uranium from Flagstaff flows to the Tinsmiths, who turn it into batteries, and most of those end up at the Puerto base.}  
{602}{}{[More]}
{603}{}{In other words, this organization aims to dominate Southern Arizona for resources, using cheap labor. They install their puppets in settlements, like in Casa Grande. They incite revolutions, as seen in San Brahmin. They seize resources and employ slaves for the task. And we don't even know who they are.}
{604}{}{[More]}
{605}{}{, now you realize your Villa is at risk. If this army continues to subjugate Southern Arizona, Villa, like other small settlements, will lose its freedom. The best chance to stop them is to unite with the Rangers and fight back together.}
{606}{}{What do you need from me now?}
{607}{}{Head to Puerto Penasco and identify the enemy's weak points. Our scouts haven't been able to gather any valuable intel - their base is too remote and too fortified.}
{608}{}{How am I supposed to do that?}
{609}{}{You're a peasant. You'll arouse less suspicion. Plus, you have a strong motive - the enslavement of Villa. Good luck.}
{1609}{}{You're a peasant girl. You'll arouse less suspicion. Plus, you have a strong motive - the enslavement of Villa. Good luck.}
{610}{}{Permission to leave, General.}
{611}{}{I think it's a suicide mission. I'm washing my hands of this, General.}
{612}{}{Reflect on what we've discussed. Perhaps your support alone could turn the tide in this war.}
{613}{}{You're right, General. I'll try to learn more about this shadowy organization.}
{614}{}{Find someone else. I'm going home; my beloved Villa is waiting, General.}

{620}{}{I managed to infiltrate the base at Puerto Penasco.}
{621}{}{Good news. What did you discover? Any weaknesses?}
{622}{}{I don't know their weaknesses yet. They're too organized and their base is too well-guarded.}
{623}{}{That's unfortunate. But I believe you'll succeed. Keep investigating.}
{624}{}{Permission to leave, General.}
{625}{}{I have another question to ask you.}
{626}{}{Their ship is likely loaded with explosives. But I haven't figured out how to approach it yet.}
{627}{}{Brilliant. If you can find a way to blow up their entire ship, it would wipe the Brotherhood off the map. Their vassals and smaller outposts will be left defenseless. Make that your goal. I believe you can do it.}
{628}{}{You know, they let me go because they offered me a similar task.}
{629}{}{So that's it... What have you decided? Whose side are you on?}
{1629}{}{So that's it... What have you decided? Whose side are you on?}
{630}{}{Of course, yours, General.}
{631}{}{Then use the trust you've gained to destroy our mutual enemy.}
{632}{}{Permission to leave, General.}
{633}{}{You can't handle them, General. Admit defeat.}
{634}{}{Admit defeat before a battle is even fought? It's a shame things turned out this way. Now, I can't let you go until we learn all we can from you. You shouldn't have crossed the Rangers.}
{635}{}{No, General. I'll be going. And no one will be able to stop me.}
{636}{}{We're no longer allies. So screw you, old man. You can't stop me.}
{637}{}{I managed to infiltrate the Brotherhood ship and set off their torpedoes. The base is completely obliterated.}
{638}{}{We haven't had news this good in years! By destroying the Brotherhood's base, you've secured our homeland for ourselves and our descendants. You have done a great deed.}
{639}{}{Thank you, General.}
{640}{}{There's still work to do wiping out the last of the Brotherhood's influence. Join us - become a Ranger - and help finish the fight. Serve the Rangers in Villa, your hometown, and keep it safe.}  
{641}{}{Thank you, General. But I want to keep my freedom and that of my village.}
{642}{}{Well, go back to your family in Villa and share the good news.}
{643}{}{Glad to serve, General.}
{1643}{}{Glad to serve, General.}
{644}{}{It's an honor to become a Ranger.}
{645}{}{Then, from this day forth, you are one of us. Keep Law and Order in your homeland. Now return to Villa and inform your people of the good news.}
{1645}{}{Then, from this day forth, you are one of us. Keep Law and Order in your homeland. Now return to Villa and inform your people of the good news.}
{646}{}{Glad to serve, General.}
{1646}{}{Glad to serve, General.}
{647}{}{We still have much to do to eradicate the remnants of the Brotherhood's evil. For now though, your mission is over. Return to Villa and share the good news with your family.}
{648}{}{Why not just assault this fort with a squad of Rangers?}
{649}{}{Our enemy is strong and well-organized. We stand no chance in an open battle. In situations like this, we say: if you want to defeat a mighty beast, cripple its legs and finish it off from a distance.}
{650}{}{I want to talk about our new enemy.}
{651}{}{Of course. Did you uncover anything?}
{652}{}{No, nothing yet.}
{653}{}{What do you know about the Puerto base?}
{654}{}{Not much. The old ship appeared in the port several years ago. No one's allowed inside; the perimeter is heavily guarded. It's tough for scouts to reach it through the desert, and besides, we've focused our forces elsewhere. You'll need to find out the details yourself.}
{655}{}{How could such a secretive organization take over so many settlements?}
{656}{}{Through shrewd policies and advanced technology. The organization in Puerto doesn't engage directly in Arizona's internal conflicts. But they're adept at provoking them. When the dust settles, their chosen leaders - puppets like Aaron - end up in charge of the settlements.}
{657}{}{Why is this such a problem for Arizona?}
{658}{}{They impose their worldview through force, which is unacceptable. Their policies strip settlements of their autonomy, leaving them in a state of servitude. Society isn't ready for their so-called "progressive" ideas.}
{659}{}{Got it. Let's backtrack a bit.}
