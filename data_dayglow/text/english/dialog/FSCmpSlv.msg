{210}{}{Request for new prisoners}
{211}{}{Report from mine administration: "Due to a labor shortage, deadlines have been missed again. The mine is killing prisoners too quickly. We'll need to find new labor in nearby settlements. Rumors of wild tribes in the west are worth investigating."}
{212}{}{Report on the western expedition}
{213}{}{The mercenaries returned with new prisoners. The peasants from Villa are surprisingly strong, healthy, and hardy. The savages are less impressive but still better than the southern prisoners. Villa also had supplies and useful items. We passed Garage City along the way; the locals offered business opportunities worth considering.}
{214}{}{Incident in the mine}
{215}{}{A group of prisoners from Villa disappeared in the mine. Either I underestimated these hicks, or our defenses are inadequate. We must enforce stricter punishments.}
{216}{}{Sending prisoners to Phoenix}
{217}{}{The fire worshippers promptly bought the toughest peasants from Villa and some savages. This was our highest quality stock. In return, we received much-needed weapons and ammunition. A great deal.}
{218}{}{Decreased meat supplies}
{219}{}{Due to issues in San Brahmin, meat supplies have decreased. We need to hunt mole rats and establish a trapper camp in the mountains. Another unexpected expense, but it's also a development opportunity.}
{220}{}{Completed excavations in Navajo}
{221}{}{The Navajo military camp was mostly useless. Almost all resources were destroyed in warehouse explosions. Only charred foundations of old buildings remain. Extracting the remaining resources is not profitable due to labor losses. The camp must be closed. We had high hopes for it...}
{222}{}{Personal note}
{223}{}{When I created this colony, I hoped to realize the New World idea. But visitors only care about caps. Dirty bastards, I'll enforce new laws and make them change!}
