{100}{}{You see Granny Judy.}
{101}{}{You see a ghoul woman in a pre-war dress.}
{102}{}{Ah-h!}
{103}{}{Now I know what Rupert was up to all this time. But... I'll forgive him this time.}

{200}{}{Hello, stranger. There are more and more new faces in Dayglow.}
{1200}{}{Hello, stranger. There are more and more new faces in Dayglow.}
{201}{}{That's right. Goodbye.}
{202}{}{Who are you?}
{203}{}{My name is Granny Judy. I came from Necropolis, like the other ghouls.}
{204}{}{I see. Goodbye, Granny.}
{205}{}{What do you do here, Judy?}
{206}{}{Every day I come to Gustavo to learn about the newly arrived or deceased. After all, he's running the real town hall. If you need to find someone, that's the place.}
{207}{}{What do you think of Gustavo?}
{208}{}{Oh, such a sweet young ghoul! He cares more about his wards than himself. We've always lacked people like him.}
{209}{}{Are you looking for someone?}
{210}{}{My husband Rupert and I got separated during the journey here. Now I can't find him. Although Cabot in Old Town says he saw him.}
{211}{}{Sorry to hear that. Goodbye.}
{212}{}{I'll help you find him.}
{213}{}{What a sweetheart you are! I'll take any help I can get.}
{1213}{}{What a darling you are! I'll take any help I can get.}
{214}{}{Then I'll look in Old Town, I suppose. Goodbye, Judy.}
{215}{}{Tell me again, when did you last see your husband?}
{216}{}{My name is Judy. You can call me Granny, dear. I came from the Necropolis, like the other ghouls.}
{217}{}{Stay strong, Granny. Your husband Rupert died in a skirmish in Little Italy.}
{218}{}{Ah! I felt it! (clutches her heart) Oh!}
{219}{}{Hey, are you okay?}

{220}{}{Hello, stranger.}
{1220}{}{Hello, stranger.}
{221}{}{Goodbye, Granny.}
