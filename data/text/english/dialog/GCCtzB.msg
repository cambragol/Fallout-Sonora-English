{100}{}{You see Todd.}
{101}{}{You see one of the few residents of Garage City.}
{102}{}{Hello. Thanks for your help with the coyotes.}

{200}{}{Hey, you. I don't remember seeing you around here. Where are you from?}
{201}{}{I'm just passing through. Why?}
{202}{}{Yeah, strangers are a rarity in our city these days. My name's Todd.}
{203}{}{Nice to meet you.}
{204}{}{If you're trying to butter me up, save it. It won't work.}

{210}{}{What do you want?}
{211}{}{Go ahead, I'm listening.}
{212}{}{Nothing. Bye.}

{220}{}{What do you do here, Todd?}
{221}{}{I'm an expert in collecting and refining iron. I've spent years honing my skills.}
{222}{}{Sounds like a lucrative business.}
{223}{}{I see.}
{224}{}{Not really. The mine is running dry, and there's little work left. Plus, there are animals near my trailer.}
{225}{}{Animals?}
{226}{}{Damn coyotes. I don't know what they smelled, but there was a whole pack of them. I'm afraid to get too close, but all my tools are in my trailer. Can you help get rid of them? I'll pay five caps per coyote, just so I can get to my home.}
{227}{}{Okay, agreed.}
{228}{}{I'm not a hunter, but I'll think about it.}
{229}{}{Actually, not really. The mine is running dry, and there's little work left. Besides, it's a dirty and tough job.}
{230}{}{I see.}
{231}{}{I'll get rid of the coyotes for you. But answer a few questions first.}
{232}{}{Where is your trailer?}
{233}{}{Go to the Wattz Electronics plant and turn left along the road.}
{234}{}{Got it. Another question.}
{235}{}{I'll handle it right now.}
{236}{}{The coyotes are taken care of.}
{237}{}{Oh, great. Time to pay up, right? Otherwise, you won't leave me alone...}
{238}{}{Unusually clean caps. Where did they come from?}
{239}{}{Goodbye.}
{240}{}{They're just well-preserved. Do you care? Take them and spend them.}
{241}{}{No questions then.}
{242}{}{I think you made them from the scrap metal you collect near the factory. Am I right?}
{243}{}{Keep it quiet! Do you care where these caps came from? Pre-war caps are rusty, but these are in good condition. Take them and keep quiet. No one will believe you anyway.}
{244}{}{I don't blame you. Just be more careful next time.}
{245}{}{Silence has a price. For 100 caps, I'll forget about this.}
{246}{}{Do you know how much work goes into making one cap? Fine, take the 100 caps. But don't tell anyone!}
{247}{}{As you wish.}

{250}{}{Tell me about Garage City.}
{251}{}{This is a scavenger camp. We pull useful things from the old city ruins, repair them, and sell them to the south.}
{252}{}{Sounds good.}
{253}{}{But the mine is almost depleted. We'll have to move on soon unless the city finds a new source of income.}
{254}{}{What do you get in exchange for your work? Corn cobs?}
{255}{}{Caps, genius! Caps! We use them like money was used in ancient times. A wallet wouldn't hurt either. Remember, nothing works without caps in the big cities.}
{256}{}{You seem to know a lot. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{257}{}{Thanks for the info. I gotta go.}
{258}{}{Got it. Can I ask one more question?}
